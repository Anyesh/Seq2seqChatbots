is this true brother buyl ? 
he must be replaced .

look man i do n't give a shit if you want sex or not but you 're payin' for my time . 
alright alright  do n't hurt me !  please it 's in my book in my purse ! 
well now that we 've got one that 's actually failed we should be able to figure out what 's happened and fix it . 
i guess you do n't know your own strength old boy . 
i guess not . 
i think i 'll have to go out and burn them off . 
roger . 
he 's got a point . 
what is it hal ? 
my f . p . c .  shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit . 
i understand hal .  we 'll take care of it .  please let me have the hard copy . 
sure dave what 's up ? 
you know that we checked the two aounits that you reported in imminent failure condition ? 
yes i know . 
you probably also know that we found them okay . 
yes i know that .  but i can assure you that they were about to fail . 
hal is there anything bothering you ?   anything that might account for this problem ? 
look dave i know that you 're sincere and that you 're trying to do a competent job and that you 're trying to be helpful but i can assure the problem is with the aounits and with your test gear . 
okay hal well let 's see the way things go from here on . 
i 'm sorry about the misunderstanding hal . 
well do n't worry about it . 
and do n't you worry about it . 
is your confidence in me fully restored ? 
yes it is hal . 
well that 's a relief .  you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission . 
yes it is . 
i suppose you 're pretty broken up about it ? 
the antenna has to be replaced . 
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation . 
it does n't have to be hal .  it 's more dangerous to be out of touch with earth .  let me have manual control please . 
i do n't really agree with you dave .  my onboard memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements . 
she 's got the same complaint as half the goddamn population .   she ca n't get the job she 's trained for and it pisses her off .  .  .  anyway what the fuck do you care ? 
mission district .   gonna find us an indian . 
last night two nights ago three ? 
you have a good time ? 
at least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you .  .  . tell me a little about her .   she got great tits ? 
it 's a long shot but .  .  . billy used to tend bar here a few years back .  i heard him talk about it . 
this part of town they 'll make us for heat the second we walk in .  just back me up like you 've got a piece .  .  . 
back you up ?   now why would i wanna do that ? 
if they kick my ass they 'll sure as hell carve yours up .  .  . 
but you can handle it all right huh ?  real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats .  .  . 
bullshit .   attitude and experience get you through .  .  . 
you need five years training to handle a joint like .  .  . 
i got two problems .   number one i 'm not playin' games .   number two you got nothin' to bet with . 
if we come outta this joint with ganz' phone number or a dead indian or anything else useful then you could turn the other way for half an hour while i get laid .  .  . 
why ?   anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably ca n't get it up anyway . 
that 's never been one of my problems . 
what are you talkin' about ? 
you tell me what ganz busted out for he 's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail .   and whatever it is you 're part of it . 
i do n't know what you 're talking about .  i just wanna see ganz nailed . 
the bet 's off . 
i thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes . 
elaine look i 'm in the middle of sone stuff right now .  .  .  i 'm not gonna have time to come by .  i do n't know when i can get there . 
this is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave . 
elaine !  i .  .  .  i 'm sorry .  .  .  i was expecting somebody else .  .  .  police business . 
no wonder you 're so popular . 
no it 's i 'm just surprised you called . 
so am i . 
jack ?   what was that ? 
jack wait .  .  . 
just a second that 's all ! 
hi it 's me .  .  . 
fuck you . 
hiya kid . 
i ought to have you and your friend thrown out .  .  . 
do n't .   we 've had a hard night . 
i can see that .   pardon me for saying so but you look like shit .   what happened ? 
we and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours .  .  . 
i 've been better .  .  . dead end .   no ganz no indian . 
ganz is going to be hard to track .  just a pure schizo  .  .  .  wires all crossed .  .  .  totally without any pattern .  .  .  kill anybody .  .  .  the indian .  .  .  himself .  .  .  anybody .  .  . 
how do you know ? 
jack it 's all over the papers .  he 's an obvious type .   but this indian .  .  . 
come on they were a little old for a slumber party . 
it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions .   i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week jack and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian  .  .  .  now if this indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him it could just be she 's still vulnerable to him . 
so what ? 
when a guy hurts you then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees who knows he might just be irrestible . 
hey come on shrink time 's over .  they would n't go see some old girlfriend . 
oh yeah well look where you came when you were down and out . 
i get it !  you want to make me beg is that it ? 
all i want is an explanation !  i just got in i lost my job .  i smashed my cab .  i got mugged but other than that everything 's peachy ma thanks for asking !  !  now settle down and explain to me calmly .  . 
ma .  if i 'd won i 'd know about it .  someone would have notified me .

i have selected you to return with me  along with several other specimens for study .   we will examine you and the others discover desirable features to incorporate in our earthcolonizers . '

my husband is a very courageous man . 
your husband is a coward .  he sends soldiers halfway around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night . 
yes

i neither enjoy nor dislike .  i do what is necessary . 
how can you ?  i mean they 're people .

jim .  .  . 
three .  .  . 
you 're very valuable .  and our nation needs so many things . 
over my dead body .

and i can hardly believe that i 'm engaged to someone like you simon .   i 'm a very lucky woman . 
but darling they 've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the jupiter probe .

i think you 're the greatest .  but my dad says you do n't work hard enough on defense . 
denver control this is flight twozero niner intersecting victor airway seven ninerniner . 
 .  .  . and that lots of times you do n't even run down court . 
we are turning left to a heading of zero ninerniner . 
 .  .  . and that you do n't really try except during the playoffs . 
the hell i do n't !  i 'm out there busting my buns every night . 
i 'm randy . 
i 'm lisa .  oh you have a guitar !

casull  . 454 magnum .   you 're talking twice the impact energy of  . 44 magnum hot loads . 
only holds five . 
yeah the shells are too big for six in an cylinder .   hell matt you do n't need but one . 
no .  .  .  two . 
well one of the men did n't like him so much .  .  . 
we think he could 'a been involved yeah .   you know him ? 
to be honest it 's hard to say .   i hate to admit it but  they all still kinda look alike to me . 
who else can i ask around here ? 
wait .   you know who it looks like ?  yeah .   anderson .   uh .  .  .  james anderson .   he is n't in today .   he took the afternoon off . 
i think you 're gonna find he 's taken the rest of his life off . 
yes it is .   thirtyfive percent pure methane gas in there .   i do n't know how these fellas do it . 
 .  .  .  they took the stuff out all of it  this afternoon . 
try joshua strader will ya darlin' ? 
for you anything . 
yeah  we met him .   wonderful boy .  .  .  close personal friend of george 's here . 
i 'm sorry matt .   nothing here seems to be matching up .  .  . 
sure .   just a minute . 
ss 'kya'ta' . 
what 's that ? 
yeah .  .  .  i seen him around .   high roller dude named strader .   joshua strader .   runs a club on the west side .   encounters . 
yeah i heard of it . 
that 's all i know .   you want anything more you ask somebody else . 
ca n't tell .   lots .   d gun's down to twenty .   ten .   it 's out . 
but they do n't know that .   they 're probably looking for other ways to get in .   that 'll take them awhile . 
maybe .   maybe not . 
hicks i 'm not going to wind up like those others .   you 'll take care of it wo n't you it if comes to that ? 
if it comes to that i 'll do us both .   let 's see that it does n't here i 'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine . 
well that 's the grenade launcher  .  .  . you probably do n't want to mess with that . 
look you started this .   now show me everything .   i can handle myself . 
yeah .   i 've noticed . 
the only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back .   then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked . 
let 's waste him .   no offense . 
get back here both of you .   fall back to operations . 
we did n't miss anything . 
stand back . 
all right !   she 's alive .   i believe it .   but we gotta get moving !   now ! 
that 's right your excellency .  i 've come on behalf of my hus band .  i 'm  i 'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment . 
how charming .   but why did he not come himself ? 
he 's terribly busy sir . 
i understand . 
would it be too much trouble sir to ask you to look at them now ?  while i wait . 
i 'm afraid i 'm not at leisure this very moment .  just leave them with me .  i assure you they will be quite safe . 
i  i really cannot do that your excellency .  you see he does n't know i 'm here . 
really ? 
my husband is a proud man sir .  he would be furious if he knew i 'd come . 
then he did n't send you ? 
no sir .  this is my own idea . 
i see . 
sir we really need this job .  we 're desperate .  my husband spends far more than he can ever earn .  i do n't mean he 's lazy  he 's not at all  he works all day long .  it 's just !  he 's not practical .  money simply slips through his fingers it 's really ridiculous your excellency .  i know you help musicians .  you 're famous for it .  give him just this one post .  we 'd be forever indebted ! 
do n't keep calling me that .  it puts me at such a distance .  i was not born a court composer you know .  i 'm from a small town just like your husband . 
that 's very tempting but it 's impossible i 'm afraid .  wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing .  you see they 're all originals . 
originals ? 
yes . 
yes sir .  he does n't make copies . 
oh yes .  he 's really proud of his work . 
oh thank you sir ! 
tonight ? 
alone . 
what for ? 
some service deserves service in return .  no ? 
what do you mean ? 
is n't it obvious ? 
but !  i 'm a married woman ! 
then do n't .  it 's up to you .  not to be vague that is the price . 
what ? 
should we stay here ?  it 's a charming room .  i love these candlesticks .  were they here earlier ?  i did n't notice them i suppose i was too nervous . 
german ! 
of course !  what else do you think they speak here ? 
no no i love that .  i 'd want it to be in german .  i have n't done anything in german since seraglio . 
so there you are .  what do you say ? 
wolfi ! 
put it down ! 
what is this ? 
put it down i said !  it 's nothing for you . 
oh !  i 'm sorry !  i 'm sorry !  what have you got for me ?  is it finished ? 
what ? 
what ?  the vaudeville what 'd you think ? 
yes . 
can i see it ? 
no . 
why not ? 
because there 's nothing to see . 
well we can . 
so let me see it .  where is it ? 
and which one of them do you want me to teach ? 
what ?  haha !  that 's funny  i like it .  which one eh ?  you 're a funny fellow .   hannah !  come this way . 
madame . 
this is herr mozart my dear .  the young man herr salieri recommended to teach our gertrude .  where is she ? 
of course it 's him .  who do you think it is ? 
strudel this is herr mozart .  say good morning . 
well yes !  on the whole .  i suppose .   how long have you been playing fraulein ? 
well i 'm a good teacher .  the next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs please let me know .  goodbye fraulein goodbye madame !  goodbye sir ! 
is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music ? 
well your pupil is married and living in mannheim young man . 
really ?  perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction ? 
what is this mozart ?  what 's the matter with you ? 
well .  since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services could you favour me with a little money instead ? 
what for ? 
if a man cannot earn he must borrow . 
well this is hardly the way to go about it . 
no doubt sir .  but i am endowed with talent and you with money .  if i offer mine you should offer yours . 
shall i be forced to feed you david ? 
this is absurd .  i 'm not hungry .  i do n't want any food . 
right . 
will you give me a break ? 
i thought you were asleep . 
i was .  what are you reading ? 
'a connecticut yankee in king arthur 's court' by mark twain . 
do you like it ? 
i 've just started it .  my friend gave it to me . 
i dream of death mostly . 
i 'm sorry .  i should n't have asked you . 
it 's okay .  i want to talk to you . 
that 's not really a very proper question . 
how old are you ? 
twentyeight . 
i 'm twentyseven . 
i know . 
now what do you want to talk about ? 
was jack goodman your good friend ? 
my best friend .  my very best friend . 
shall i read to you ? 
what ?  oh yes please . 
a connecticut yankee in king arthur 's court by samuel l .  clemens .  this is after the preface but before chapter one a word of explanation .  you all right ? 
yes go on . 
ahem a word of explanation .  it was in warwick castle that i came across the curious stranger whom i am going to talk about .  he attracted me by three things his candid simplicity his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor and the restfulness of his company  for he did all the talking .  we fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd .  .  . 
i 'm sorry i woke you up . 
do n't be silly .  can i get you something ? 
no thank you .  just keep me company for a while . 
that 's easy enough . 
i keep having these really terrible dreams .  they are getting worse and i ca n't seem to stop them . 
david your dreams will stop .  you 'll leave england and your bad memories and then this will all fade away . 
will you come with me ? 
what ? 
i 'm serious .  you do n't know me and i know nothing about you .  we have a perfect relationship . 
now david i said i would keep you company but i meant right here and now . 
will you think about it ? 
how did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient ? 
not just a patient  me . 
you 're being awfully forward are n't you ? 
forgive me i 'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it . 
all i am to you is a sex fantasy then ? 
now i 'm embarrassed . 
good .  i thought for a moment i was the only embarrassed one in the room . 
a werewolf ? 
i 'll let you know the next full moon . 
you 're to be discharged tomorrow .  will you be all right ? 
your dead friend jack ? 
yeah .  he says that i will become a monster in two days .  what do you think ? 
what do i think ?  you mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends ? 
i was dreaming again ? 
i would think so . 
yeah i would think so too . 
very nice . 
campari and soda would do nicely . 
sorry love . 
i suppose guinness will suffice . 
oh that 's been there for two hundred years .  we were going to paint it out but it 's traditional so we left it . 
i see .  you 've heard nothing about the incident ? 
no . 
we 've got spirits and beer .  if it 's something hot you want you can have tea . 
then you have some hot tea ? 
no . 
oh . 
but i can heat some up for you if you 'd like . 
i beg your pardon ? 
i 'd like some tea please . 
has mr .  kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors ? 
sgt .  mcmanus are you suggesting that david and jack were in fact attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of east proctor has conspired to keep it a secret ?  we have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police .  we have two witnesses to the crime .  you 'll forgive me mr .  kessler if i consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock . 
lieutenant the boy seems pretty lucid to me and .  .  . 
and what sergeant ? 
i do n't rightly know sir . 
that is precisely my point .  david as far as we are concerned the matter is closed .  we wo n't trouble you any further .  good day . 
we 'll find him not to worry . 
you here again ?  what do you want ? 
sure i think it 's swell . 
say come on .  show a little enthusiasm .  what 's the matter ?  are you sick or something ?  go on fake it  even if it is n't real . 
aw go on forget it .  you came through did n't you ?  that 's all i wanted .  a lot of them did n't think you would .  you do n't know how much satisfaction it 's been to me .  it 's been swell .  well when are you and helen going to get married ? 
well i
i suppose you want me to fix that up for you too eh ? 
there you are . 
i ca n't tell you . 
you 're protecting somebody . 
no i 'm not mr .  dickson ! 
yes you are .  you 're protecting somebody .  now listen it does n't make any difference who it is .  it ca n't be as important as this .  now come on tell me .  where were you last night ?   come on do n't be a fool .  matt you trust me do n't you ? 
why would n't you tell me where you were last night ? 
you 're not giving up are you mr .  dickson ? 
were you in cluett 's apartment ? 
oh i can explain about that later .  you 're losing your bank  do n't you realize what that means ? 
was mrs .  dickson there ? 
listen mr .  dickson do n't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down .  you 've got more friends than anybody in this town .  little guys  guys who would n't be in business if it were n't for you .  all you 've got to do is
wait a minute .  answer my question .  was mrs .  dickson there ? 
well  .   .   .  uh  .   .   .  i  .   .   . 
she was was n't she ?  how long has this been going on ?  do you know ? 
aw i do n't know what you 're talking about .  all i know is that you 're losing your bank and
all right .  that 's all .   please matt . 
but i have n't  .   .   . 
i do n't want to hear any more about it .  if you do n't get married i 'll fire both of you . 
gee thanks mr .  dickson
i 'm afraid i must mr .  dickson . 
why pick on him  ? 
it 's an inside job .  that 's a cinch .  whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout .  now brown here is in charge of the vaults is n't he ? 
yes . 
the clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 1209 . 
all right .  if the boy proves an alibi he 's all right is n't he ? 
if he can do it yes . 
why certainly he can .   matt now all you 've got to do is tell them where you were last night between twelve and twelvethirty and everything will be all right . 
what 's going on ? 
i could use the walk . 
suit yourself .  we 'll have some horses waiting for you at the road .   let 's ride rangers ! 
there 's yankees back there .  lot 's of em . 
planting corn .  harvesting corn .  year after year . 
you 're not scared are you ? 
pick your fights cousin .  you taught me that . 
what is wrong with you ? 
in case we have to kill these sonofabitches i do n't want them to see us coming . 
she got two of them . 
she was european ! 
all right calm down .  i 'll agree sadie was a woman 
after all you did on our farm ?   you miss it do n't you jesse ? 
the war ?  what are you crazy ?   there are things i miss about it . 
it was exciting . 
but it was a whole lot of killing .  why should we miss that ? 
yeah . 
shush . 
you were little jesse james when you left . 
but you got big ! 
if there 's anything we can do for you dr .  mimms .  we want to help . 
mmmm . 
nuhhuh  .  .  . 
i 've been on my back two weeks .  i 'm sick of it . 
you 're sick of my company ? 
no !  i mean of course not .  no . 
teasing you is completely unfair . 
what you do to me is unfair .  the teasing i mean . 
i should n't tease a hero . 
what ? 
everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued cole .  we 're all so proud of you jesse .  and not a single farm 's been sold to the railroad since .  you 're everybody 's hero . 
i was n't the only one risking my neck that day . 
so you 're saying i should leave you alone and go spend time with jimmy younger ? 
unfair .  you are completely unfair . 
you did n't want to farm ? 
i was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate . 
a river pirate . 
arr .  hand over your jewels missy . 
thank god you grew out of that .   you did grow out of that did n't you ? 
mostly .  it would be an all right life for a bachelor . 
you planning on being a bachelor your whole life jesse james ? 
not if i find the right girl . 
and what 's this right girl like ? 
smart .  funny .  bossy .  always makes me think she 's two steps ahead of me .  and big buck teeth . 
where will you find such a girl ? 
honestly you 'd do if only you had the buck teeth . 
sparkling rocks ? 
little ones . 
is this one of frank 's shakespeare poems you 're trying to quote ? 
yep . 
were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting ? 
i 've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time . 
frank and me have to go away for a while . 
me neither . 
let the law 
laws do n't touch men like thaddeus rains .  only justice does . 
whose justice ?  yours or god 's ?   when will you stop ? 
when my name makes them cry in their sleep .  when i 've brought them to ashes . 
how did you guess ? 
girls dig bateman .  he 's cq .  you 're total cq bateman . 
thanks guy but .  .  . she 's got a lousy personality . 
ed gein ?  maitre d' at canal bar ? 
no serial killer wisconsin in the fifties .  he was an interesting guy . 
is that all you ever have to contribute van patten ?  what about fucking dinner ? 
no . 
i 'm looking for .  .  . paul owen's .  .  . place . 
no he does n't . 
are you sure ? 
you saw the ad in the times ? 
no .  yes .  i mean yes i did .  in the times .  but .  .  .  does n't paul owen still live here ? 
there was no ad in the times . 
but i think .  .  . i want to know what happened here . 
do n't make any trouble .  please .  i suggest you go . 
i wo n't .  .  . do n't worry . 
face itthe japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s . 
yes naturally . 
bateman killing owen and the escort girls ?  oh that s fabulous .  that 's rich .  .  . 
dan great to see you again .  like i said you need anything at all i 'm your man .  i do n't envy your job .  i mean owen was a .  .  . complex man . 
yeah gone into rehab .  shame .   is he a suspect ? 
not really . 
god .  .  . i guess .  .  . i was probably returning videotapes . 
wait .  that 's not what i 've got . 
what ? 
that 's not the information i 've received . 
well .  .  . i .  .  . wait .  .  . what information have you received ? 
let 's see .  .  .   that you were with
well i could he wrong . 
well .  .  . when was the last time you were with paul owen ? 
we had .  .  . gone to a new musical called .  .  . oh africa brave africa .  it was .  .  . a laugh riot .  .  . and that 's about it .  i think we had dinner at orso 's .  no petaluma .  no orso 's .  the .  .  . last time i physically saw him was .  .  . at an automated teller .  i ca n't remember which .  .  . just one that was near um nell 's . 
patrick please .  i hope i 've been informative .  long daya bit scattered . 
listen i 'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when i 've sorted out all this information ? 
great yes i 'd like that . 
and if you could try and pin down where you were the night of owen's disappearance it would make my job a lot easier . 
absolutely .  i 'm with you on that one . 
not a big music fan eh ? 
no i like music .  justthey 'rehuey 's too .  .  .  black sounding .  for me . 
well to each his own .  solunch thursday ?  i 'll call your secretary about reservations . 
i 'll be there . 
not in the mood i guess . 
but .  .  . everyone orders the hash browns here .  i mean it 'shave you been here before ? 
yes of course .  the hash browns are delicious .  i 'm just .  .  . not .  .  .  ordering them . 
suit yourself i guess . 
i 'm not really sure .  i had a shower .  .  . and some sorbet ? 
i think maybe you 've got your dates mixed up . 
but how ?  where do you place paul that night ? 
according to his date book and this was verified by his secretary he had dinner with .  .  . marcus halberstam . 
and ? 
i 've questioned him . 
marcus ? 
yes .  and he denies it .  though at first he could n't be sure . 
but marcus denied it ? 
yes . 
well does marcus have an alibi ? 
yes . 
i checked it out .  it 's clean . 
oh .  kimball now where were you ?  
where was marcus ? 
he was n't with paul owen . 
so who was he with ? 
he was at atlantis with craig mcdermott frederick dibble harry newman george butner and    you . 
personally i think the guy went a little nutso .  split town for a while .  maybe he did go to london .  sightseeing .  drinking .  whatever .  anyway i 'm pretty sure he 'll turn up sooner or later .   i mean to think that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous .  is n't that right patrick ? 
 .  .  . worse ? 
cause he was a liar .  and i hated him .   get your head out of that machine wise up to the real world .  the more he mocked me the deeper i went .  cause if being savvy meant being like him   guess that 's why i 'm kind of clueless even now .  did n't cultivate my conniving side .  not sure i even have one . 
do n't be so hard on yourself .  with a brain like yours you could connive with the best of em i bet . 
'sorry about the late notice .  .  . 
i could n't do it at work cause of security or at home for  obvious reasons . 
i 'm not much good at handwriting .  or parties . 
oh that 's right .  you 're clueless . 
you see what 's hanging on the wall ? 
i do know gary .  i feel the same way .  i thought i was coming here for a job .  but it 's meant a lot more . 
i do know .  you focus on the big problem .  but somewhere down the chain something breaks down .  something gets destroyed .  at first it 's upsetting .  you feel you 've lost control . 
'startup not 50 miles from here .  kid 's on prozac . 
maybe we should all get on it . 
there may be a little less trust after your outburst . 
nothing does .  still .  i want him to like me . 
hey mick ! 
are you more satisfied now sexually austin ? 
well you ca n't always get what you want . 
you ca n't always get what you want !  that 's a great title for a song !  i 'm gonna write that and it 'll be a big hit . 
good on ya man . 
groovy ! 
well destructacon 5000 you have quite a head on your shoulders i dare to coin . 
yes i am programmed to answer any question . 
really ?  let me ask you this .  what is love ? 
that does not compute . 
why not ?  it 's a question . 
love is .  .  .  love is .  .  .  love is .  .  . 
do n't try to suck up to me !  it 's a little late for that .  i 'm a freak !  look at it it 's been rendered useless . 
oh forget it .  as a fellow player on the international stage mr .   powers i 'm sure you 'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act . 
no mr .  powers i expect them to die .  even after they pay me the money i 'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma .   all right guard begin the unnecessarily slowmoving dipping mechanism . 
well done mr .  powers .  we 're not so different you and i .  it 's true you 're british and i 'm belgian .  you have a full head of hair mine is slightly receding .  you 're thin i 'm about forty pounds overweight .  ok we are different i 'm not making a very good point .  however is n't it ironic mr .  powers that the very things you stand for swinging free love parties distrust of authority are all now in the nineties considered to be .  .  .  evil ?  maybe we have more in common than you care to admit . 
no man what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you whose bag was money and world domination .  we were innocent man .  if we 'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation we would have done things differently but the spirit would have remained the same .   it 's freedom man . 
your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan i ever dreamed of .  face it freedom failed . 
that 's why right now is a very groovy time man .  we still have freedom but we also have responsibility . 
really there 's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster . 
not really .  kill the little bastard .  see what i care . 
man you are one chilly square ! 
well as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection while at the same time experimenting with mindexpanding drugs in a consequencefree environment i 'll be sound as a pound . 
my mother 's told me all about you . 
if it 's a lie goddamn her .  it it 's the truth goddamn me .   god i hope that 's witty .  how 's your mum ? 
my mother 's doing quite well thank you very much . 
listen mr .  powers i look forward to working with you but do me a favor and stop calling me baby .  you can address me as agent kensington .  we have to leave immediately .  we 've preserved your private jet just as you left it .  it 's waiting at heathrow airport . 
my jumbo jet ?  smashing baby . 
i went to oxford and excelled in several subjects but i ended up specializing in foreign languages .  i wanted to travel  see the world .  in my last year i was accepted into the m . o . d .  in the cultural studies sector .  i thought i was off on an exciting career but my job was to read everything printed in every country .  it 's very boring .  my whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in farsi .  if i do well with this case i finally get promoted to field operative .  .  . 
that 's fascinating vanessa .  listen why do n't we go into the back and shag ? 
i beg your pardon ? 
i 've been frozen for thirty years man i want to see if my bits and pieces are still working . 
excuse me ? 
my wedding tackle . 
i 'm sorry ? 
my meat and two veg . 
mr .  powers please .  i know that you must be a little confused but we have a very serious situation at hand .  i would appreciate it if you 'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest . 
have you ever made love to a chigro ? 
a chigro ? 
you know a chigro .  .  .  part chinese part negro .  .  .   chigro . 
we do n't use the term negro' anymore .  it 's considered offensive . 
that 's right .  you 're supposed to say colored' now right ?   here 's the stewardesses !  bring on the sexy stews ! 
out in india .  so characterforming for the british .  not the heat .  good lord no .  the rain dash it .  a good monsoon .  fifteen inches overnight .  a whole week of lovely rain .  i remember one summer in jaipur  .  .  . 
have we met ? 
you mean you do n't recall ?  ? 
promised ?  who promised ? 
there look ! 
sir august .  .  .  ?   what now ? 
mr .  john steed please . 
i 'm afraid that 's impossible . 
impossible ? 
as you see . 
then you ca n't come in . 
i have an appointment . 
no women .  not in boodles .  not since 1922 . 
really  what happened in 1922 ? 
eh ?  in here ! 
if nature gives a man a collector 's mind it does n't matter what he collects .  butterflies .  old china .  penny farthings .  a true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass . 
we have met  .  .  . 
this is n't a game . 
quite right but we still make the rules . 
rules are made to be broken . 
people too . 
then who wins ? 
you and i .  together .  but first you must confront your greatest enemy .  who could that be mrs .  peel ?  the answer is obvious  .  .  .

let me guess  wonderland weather . 
very good mrs .  peel  .  .  . 
i shall need a small plane . 
you 're not venturing alone surely .

so you say  .  .  . 
we want mrs .  peel . 
dead i 'm afraid . 
how did you guess ? 
you reek of mrs .  peel 's black leather  .  .  . 
it was you who gave valentine peel his security clearance  .  .  .  you 're the mole who betrayed the ministry . 
well you found me .  have a sniff of this why do n't you ?  careful the scent can be overpowering  .  .  . 
brenda and i thought we 'd drop in . 
you did n't come to talk about the weather surely . 
oh yes i did .  i want you to meet somebody .   i expect you 'll like her .

you know finlandia vodka ?   yes ? 
yes i know .   jukka have you ever seen a negro person before ?   even had a real conversation with a real negro before ? 
what 's a negro . 
did you just ask me what 's a negro ?  i 'm a negro !  !  ! 
ahhh !  !  !   i never heard of that term before .   i thought you were black of africanamerican .   no ? 
well before there was black or african american there were negroes .   i 'm a negro . 
thank you for correcting my ignorance .   i 'm looking forward to working side by side with you .   i feel we make a good team . 
my visual style is very erotic sexy how do you say  hot ? 
this is a tv show not a music video . 
then will you teach me what i need to know .   maybe we learn from each other if that 's possible no ? 
this is a travesty .   a debacle . 
thank you very much .   i always try my best . 
first i would like to say i love the show .   it 's very courageous .  my parents marched in selma alabama with dr .  king . 
the prince left him only that choice . 
when is he to go ? 
what is to be done ? 
oh i am grateful to you sir .   i am the wife of captain o 'reilly hastening to join him at dublin .   my chair was stopped by a highwayman this great oaf of a servantman fell down on his knees armed as he was and though there were thirty people in the next field working when the ruffian attacked not one of them would help but on the contrary wished him good luck . 
everything  my purse containing upwards of a hundred guineas my jewels my snuffboxes watches .  and all because this blundering coward fell to his knees .  .  . 
i am riding to dublin myself and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap . 
but i should n't like to put you to such trouble mister .  .  .  ? 
o 'higgins .  .  .  mohawk o 'higgins . 
that 's very kind of you mr .  o 'higgins . 
you must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in dublin where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound .  i hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house where captain o 'reilly will welcome with delight my gallant young preserver . 
mr .  newcombe i have made some difficult loans during the past few years at very onerous terms but 18 a year interest seems very stiff indeed . 
considering your financial circumstances mr .  cosgrove it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you .   i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity .  but obviously if you would reject this offer i shall keep trying to find a better one . 
i am prepared to accept the terms mr .  newcombe . 
there are a few other points we should discuss .   the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship 's signature and provided that bracegirdle and chatwick can be assured of her ladyship 's freewill in giving her signature . 
provided that they can be assured of her ladyship 's freewill ?   are you serious ? 
may i be quite frank with you ? 
yes of course . 
mister bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life and meditated a separation in which case she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance and subject them at any rate to a doubtful and expensive litigation .  they were quite insistent on this point and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship 's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital . 
i see . 
when i asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship 's assurances they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth in their presence at their countinghouse in birchin lane london .   i requested they come here and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to london but they declined saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to castle hackton to negotiate as they were aware of how other respectable parties such as messrs .  sharp and salomon had been treated here . 
now just have a little patience my boy .   your birthday is n't until next week . 
but i will have it on my birthday wo n't i ? 
well we 'll just have to wait and see wo n't we ? 
levi you got about four hours before armed men show up here put you on a plane to washington and lock you in a very small dark room .  i suggest you talk to us . 
but not the only victim right ? 
my my my how did things turn so hostile so quickly ?  if i did n't know better i 'd say you two were out to get me . 
senator daddy must be thrilled . 
he is not shall we say wild about the idea .  he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities and i have done my best to oblige him .  however in the last four weeks i began a relationship with another cadet .  what do you think of that ? 
i think you just blew do n't ask do n't tell out of the fucking water . 
the sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled .  my father interceded so instead west sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that i was gay . 
you said you wanted to know what happened  i 'm telling you the truth . 
what happened to degrees ? 
i did n't kill him 
then who did ? 
but you did n't . 
no .  poetic justice though . 
right in front of us .  mueller went after him but we held him back . 
i honestly do n't know .  maybe to have someone to cover for him .  and i wish i could but there 's no doubt in my mind he killed those men . 
mr .  hardy ? 
stop . 
how many murders did you cover up ?  one ?  five ?  maybe an even ten . 
can i go to jail for punching a guy who 's been shot ? 
although that wo n't matter much when coupled with the murder charge 
the faggot speaks . 
you ever been in a hurricane mueller ? 
you ever been in a hurricane mueller ? 
oh yeah excuse me sergeant sir we do n't feel like going out  we do n't want to get rained on .  he 'll kick our asses from here to cleveland . 
poor fucker my ass .  .  . 
you better watch it faggot i 'm not sure you and childs did n't do him 
yeah and he does n't know when 
i remember now it was before the explosion 
oh you remember now 
i 'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly 
so you took off your shirt ? 
to start a fire goddammit !   what about him huh ?  maybe he offed the sarge and changed shirts brought an extra one in his pack .  y 'ever think of that ?  go ahead cut him loose !  first chance he gets he 'll waste the rest of us that 's how they work 
what the truth ?  please .  there are degrees of truth officer always degrees .  things are not what they seem . 
he wanted more than that . 
you 're gonna die tonight faggot .  clear as day . 
no one else heard it ? 
he whispered it in my ear . 
because he 'd shot mueller . 
but you did n't see it right ? 
like i said i was in the kitchen .  when i came out mueller and pike were dead nunez and childs were hit and dunbar was gone . 
your mom says i ca n't tell you that one anymore .  you get nightmares . 
i 'm not scared . 
am i ? 
having a kid changes everything .  i mean there 's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings .  .  . 
did you do any of that ? 
no but i hear it 's terrible .  then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine . 
you think i 'm up for it ? 
you learned from the best . 
really . 
truly .  i saw it in the eye . 
the old lady by the swamp . 
she was a witch . 
no she was old and probably senile .  maybe schizophrenic . 
i saw my death in that eye .  and this is not how it happens . 
so how does it happen ? 
surprise ending .  would n't want to ruin it for you . 
okay . 
and every day i gave him a quarter .  every day .  then i got sick and was out for a couple of weeks .  and when i went back there you know what he said ? 
what did he say ? 
you owe me threefifty . 
really . 
true story . 
there 's a lot you do n't know about me . 
you 're right . 
you mean while i 'm here . 
i 'd just like to know the true versions of things .  events .  stories .  you . 
i will . 
you know where the chemicals are ? 
i used to do it when you were gone remember ?  i used to do it a lot . 
i said this is n't how i go .  the last part is much more unusual .  trust me on that . 
it 's rude to talk about religion .  you never know who you 're going to offend . 
oh so you know . 
what ? 
i saw you waiting there by the gate . 
i .  .  . 
i have these uh .  .  .  she explains to you .  .  .  when i was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses .  like .  .  .  i do n't know the word .  like for watching uh .  .  .  for watching the birds . 
binoculars .  he had these binoculars he has kept from the war . 
oh nothing . 
tell me . 
no .  it is too judgmental . 
tell me what he said . 
he says why did you send to russia for a wife . 
no .  it 's not that . 
do you believe in love ? 
i suppose it 's .  .  .  i mean define your terms . 
it 's very strange .  how many people are truly themselves with their love ?  it is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers .  there are no marches against heartache no ministries against loneliness no concerts against disappointment .  we look away .  and still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us .  the one thing we all share but do n't say .  look john i will show you something . 
fine .  i thought you were leaving today . 
to be indoors on such a day .  it 's crime . 
you can stay tonight . 
i have brought you trouble .  maybe i should have come alone . 
good night . 
john . 
put the fucking kettle down .  tell yuri tell him put it down or i 'm going to make him . 
what ?  what does he want ? 
he says you are very sad ridiculous man .  i do n't agree of course .  and that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute .  nadia is a prostitute .  i 'm sorry . 
what does he want .  the russian shithead .  what do you want  ? 
he wants money . 
tell him to put the kettle down and i 'll give him money . 
yeah .

the world needs dreamers .  to relieve the pain of consciousness . 
pleasure to meet you john . 
nice to meet you . 
there was a mistake . 
i 'll say .  you killed his goddam girlfriend instead .  now they 're onto neski .  they 're at the brecker hotel even as we speak . 
will it track back to us ? 
no .  the files are spotless .  whatever they find it 's just going to make conklin look worse . 
and the landy woman ? 
she 's done everything i wanted .  she bit on conklin so fast it was laughable .  she even found his bogus swiss account .  .  . 
anything else ? 
one last push .  one . 
what do you mean ? 
go to the airport .  get a plane .  i 'll have a brass band waiting for you . 
save it for bourne . 
what ? 
bourne comes here ?  why ? 
i do n't know .  he was sick .  he wanted out .  i believed him . 
alright .  .  . 
so ? 
felt promising .  it 's a start . 
yup .  .  .   the main word there the file heading translates as treadstone . 
what the hell is a treadstone ? 
no .  munich 's a bust .  he 's loose . 
are we locked up ? 
yeah that 'll work .  .  . what the hell was he doing here ? 
by who ? 
his wife .  in room 645 .  then she shot herself .  
alright .  .  .  i want you kurt and kim to stay on bourne track everything that 's out there .  .  . 
are we hacking or asking ? 
yes .  in that order . 
and what about you anything ? 
we just had a funeral is n't that what it means in england as well ? 
what it means in england  and in scotland too  is that rebels have forfeited their lands .  we were ambushed last night .  but the scots dragged their dead away . 
my brother and nephew perished two days ago when their hay cart turned over . 
then we 'll just have a peek at the wounds .   dig em up ! 
they 've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of god 's church and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation .  so please  do it . 
i do n't want to leave . 
did n't want your father to die either did ya ?  but it happened . 
it was in latin sir . 
non loquis latinum ?  you do n't speak latin ?  we have to fix that wo n't we ?   did he give the poetic benediction ?  the lord bless thee and keep thee ?  patris benefactum et    .  .  . it was malcolm 's favorite . 
thanks .  do n't worry evan you 'll have plenty of time . 
um .  .  .  can dad come this time ? 
you know the answer to that . 
ca n't he come out for one day ? 
we 've been over this a hundred times .  it 's too dangerous for him . 
but lenny said that his dad 's coming .  .  .  and tommy and kayleigh 's dad .  .  . 
i get the point kiddo .  but i 'm not so bad am i ? 
no . 
good .  because i 've been waiting to see your art projects all week and i 'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there . 
you 'll be fine .  dr .  redfield just wants to give you some tests .  you 'll like him . 
my father has a bad memory too ? 
great .  i 'll see you soon . 
honey .  what were you doing with that ? 
i .  .  .  i do n't remember . 
okay . 
something must 've happened !  what set him off ? 
i .  .  .  i blacked out . 
do n't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one ! 
i ca n't help it .  i 'm just so proud of you .  you 've got the highest grades in all of your classes . 
did da  jason  get good grades ? 
please .  he got straight a 's without ever touching a book .  that was the one area where his memory never failed him . 
ma ?  did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time ? 
yeah .  i 've been keeping journals since i was seven . 
wow .  .  .  read something . 
deal .  now read me something . 
it was like tommy was possessed or something .  there was a hate in his eyes that i could n't really call human . 
maybe because they never do .   so don juan you pass out on all your dates ? 
sure .  i was gonna make a new one anyway . 
gee thanks friend . 
yeah good what else do you remember ? 
drop it or i 'll slit your mother 's throat in her sleep . 
y .  .  .  yes .  i guess i did . 
forget it .  what 's the point of psych now ?  tomorrow i could wake up as some dirt farmer in bangladesh . 
my mom packed for me .  i think she sent everything i ever owned .  so we 'll see . 
no . 
maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life . 
but what about us ? 
we 'll always have paris .  we did n't have we 'd lost it until you came to casablanca .  we got it back last night . 
and i said i would never leave you . 
and you never will .  but i 've got a job to do too .  where i 'm going you ca n't follow .  what i 've got to do you ca n't be any part of .  ilsa i 'm no good at being noble but it does n't take much to see that the problems of three little people do n't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world .  someday you 'll understand that .  now now .  .  . 
she tried everything to get them and nothing worked .  she did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me but that was all over long ago .  for your sake she pretended it was n't and i let her pretend . 
hello miss ilsa .  i never expected to see you again . 
yes ma 'am .  a lot of water under the bridge .

oh he never .  .  .  well .  .  .   he 's got a girl up at the blue parrot .  he goes up there all the time . 
you used to be a much better liar sam . 
leave him alone miss ilsa .  you 're bad luck to him .

i do n't know what you mean miss ilsa . 
play it sam .  play as time goes by . 
oh i ca n't remember it miss ilsa .  i 'm a little rusty on it . 
if we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us .  perhaps ugarte 's in some other part of the cafe . 
wo n't you join us ? 
victor i 'm afraid for you . 
we have been in difficult places before have n't we ? 
be careful . 
i will do n't worry .

serves me right for asking a direct question .  the subject is closed . 
well it looks like you 're a little late .

yeah ?  why ? 
why do you interfere with my little romances ? 
put it down as a gesture to love . 
well i forgive you this time .  but i 'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde and it will make me very happy if she loses .  uh huh !

it 's our dog .   it belongs to us . 
there is n't any us .

i 'm never bored !  it 's all very .  .  .  different for me .  .  .  here . 
when i 'm not thinking about wally .  i 'm not good at being alone .   oh goodness .  you meant .  .  .  yes i 'm fine .  i .  .  .    .  .  . i do n't suppose you 've seen a lobster yet .

okay .  then you can be of use . 
where 'd she get you ? 
she just plan misunderstand mei was tryin' to give her my knife i was just reachin' to touch her hand .  but i understand if she misunderstand meit 's all my fault ai n't that right ? 
that 's cause i sticked my own knife in the woundafter she go i sticked my own knife in there .  i poked it all around i just tryin' to find the same place she got me . 
right ? 
yes for both . 
i presume you 'd prefer handling the delivery . 
all i said was i do n't want to perform abortions .  i have no argument with you performing them . 
you know how to help these women how can you not feel obligated to help them when they ca n't get help anywhere else ? 
one it 's illegal .  two i did n't ask how to do ityou just showed me . 
what else could i have showed you homer ?  the only thing i can teach you is what i know !  in every life you 've got to be of use . 
no .  the fetus was dead .  her uterus was virtually disintegratingmy stitches pulled right through the tissue ! 
it looks like scurvy . 
scurvy !  ah yes the curse of the old time sailor suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables .  homer dorothy is n't a sailor ! 
obviously . 
i do n't know it . 
if you take enough of it your intestines lose their ability to absorb vitamin c . 
in other words scurvy . 
good boy .  good job .  and you call yourself not a doctor !   keep an eye on hershe 's in trouble . 
i have n't read that . 
i have n't either .  but you will .  the morons who write the books should do a little research here . 
but is n't fuzzy just .  .  .  well underdeveloped ? 
when does n't he have bronchitis ?  i would n't call his bronchial infections underdeveloped .  would you ? 
we got our stake .  now we need to find our guy in gillett 's bank . 
back in wwi or wwii one of the ww 's if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match some nazi would be able to figure out where you were .  then well .  .  .  it was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had .  so three on a match is bad luck . 
you 're a superstitious fucker . 
luck 's a funny thing .  especially the bad . 
like what ? 
having a gun pointed at you for one .  it 's not like breaking a mirror bad luck but it 's bad .  three on a match black cats .  .  .  believe it .  believe it all . 
my father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy .  the same numbers everyday for sixteen years .  one day he gets pissed off tells them he 's out and plays his own numbers .  they hit the lucky seven for one point two million . 
you know when the first con was ever played ?  it was when adam fell for eve in the garden of eden . 
i was doing it for them . 
bullshit !  you were scared jake !  you lost your nerve !  you lost your confidence !  you were n't being noble .  you were n't trying to save anybody but yourself !  admit it . 
it 's not true . 
yes it is jake !  yes it is !  they were right there for you .  she was right there for you !  look at her ! 
after you cut her loose . 
she walked . 
today ?  started off great .  .  . 
probably safe in the hands of the federal government . 
it 's like putting on a play where everyone knows their part except for the mark . 
like putting on a play .  .  .  guess some people forgot their lines . 
guess so . 
so why do n't you take a deep breath jake and i 'll count to ten .  one .  two .  three .  .  . 
let 's see .  .  .  let 's suppose he gets to customs and he gets caught .  we get our money back but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation .  i do n't much like that idea .  then again let 's suppose he actually gets through customs .  now that 'll be something .  we recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud .  we double our money . 
so we go to the bar . 
i think so .  the airport 's going to be crawling with police .  traffic will be a nightmare .  go down to the bar .  if they pull it off great .  have someone deal with ashby . 
we 'll take care of it . 
and how much did you say you wanted for this .  .  .  what did you call it ?  a finder 's fee ? 
no i 'm not going to take it easy .  you ca n't stay clear of this guy .  he will be on this until the end of time . 
hey we fucked once honey .  that hardly makes you a good judge of character .  and do n't think i did n't know you were working some angle with that either . 
everyone 's working an angle right ? 
there are three people i trust  him him and a guy who got killed .  i do n't know who you are !  you 're like some stray dog that wandered into the house .  so i 'm telling you to cut loose of this .  no one 's looking for you not the king not moonan and not gillette .  just go wherever it is you would go .  it 's over . 
what about what ? 
what about the money ? 
no i want my cut ! 
i 'm going to say this one last time for you so take a deep breath and count to ten .  there is no cut . 
your friend big al ?  it should have been you . 
it 's me .  it 's jake .  listen .  .  .  it 's happening .  gordo 's landing right now .  meet me at the euclid .  .  .  for your cut i mean .  it 's .  .  .  i want you to have it . 
you sold me out .  you should have trusted me like i trusted you .  you fucked up .  you fucked up huge . 
what do you want ?  an apology ? 
no i want my cut ! 
if you wanna help then help .  if not shut up . 
your mess . 
then shut up .

it 's not just inner beauty is it ?

they took my daughter . 
i know . 
i could n't get to her .   it all happened so fast .   logan had her and i saw him fall .  .  . then peter told me to run .   and then he .  .  . and i remember so clearly thinking it 's me they want .   if i run maybe they 'll come after me .   maybe they wo n't think about her .  .  .  so i ran .  .  . 
can you help me get her back ? 
look i 'd really like to .  .  .

what do you want ? 
a tag on your toe .  nobody threatens me and lives . 
look you can have my wallet .  .  . 
it 's not nearly enough punk . 
it was just like she described them in her book .  like they were alive .  the way that they looked .  .  .  moved .  .  .  smelled .  they were like workers .  .  .  assigned to each one of us .   i followed my spear .  .  .  and i found something .  .  . 
what did you find ? 
have you told gretchen about the spears ? 
yeah but if i told her about the other stuff about frank .  .  . 
are you embarrassed by these things that you see ? 
you know .  .  .  every week i come in here and i tell you stuff .  .  .  and it 's all embarrassing .  i tell you stuff that i do n't tell anyone else .  .  .  and you know what ?  it 's your turn dr .  thurman .  i 'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself . 
i know . 
i mean .  .  .  gretchen .  .  .  she wo n't even let me kiss her .  she says because it 's our first kiss .  .  .  she 's like waiting for this big .  .  .  moment or something .  i just do n't get it .  i just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff . 
the good stuff . 
yeah .  .  .  you know .  .  .   fucking . 
have you ever made love donald ? 
yes . 
so your parents .  .  .  why did you disappoint them ? 
i .  .  .  i was playing with fire . 
is it frank who wants you to destroy the world to set the world on fire ? 
but it was an accident .  the house was under construction . 
people get hurt .  i do n't want to hurt anyone . 
but you were punished . 
yes .  i went to jail . 
do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead ? 
they .  .  .  did n't buy me what i wanted for christmas that year . 
what did you want for christmas that year ? 
hungry hungry hippos . 
how did you feel .  .  .  being denied those hungry hungry hippos ? 
regret . 
what else makes you feel regret ? 
that i did it again . 
you 've done it again ? 
yes .  i flooded my school .  .  .  and i burned down that pervert 's house .  i think i only have a few days left .  .  .  before they catch me . 
why did you do these things donnie ?  did frank tell you to commit these crimes ? 
if god exists ? 
i think now that he might .  .  . 
why ? 
because i 'm so horny . 
god exists because you 're horny . 
i think so .  i think that 's one of the clues .  it 's a clue that tells us .  .  .  to keep going . 
where are we going ? 
i have the power to build a time machine . 
how is that possible ? 
grandma death will teach me how .  soon . 
then how is time travel possible ? 
it would have to be god 's portal .  they will lead me to it .  then i will go back in time .  .  .  and i wo n't feel regret anymore . 
when will this happen ? 
soon .  time is almost up . 
frank is going to kill . 
who is he going to kill ? 
where is he donald ? 
he 's right there .  .  .  he can read my mind and he 'll show me the way out of this .  the sky is going to open up .  .  .  and then he will reveal himself to me . 
if the sky were to suddenly open up .  .  .  there would be no law .  .  .  there would be no rule .  there would only be you and your memories .  .  .  the choices you 've made and the people you 've touched .  the life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged .  .  .  by which you must judge yourself .  because when this world ends there will only be you and him .  .  .  and no one else . 
it 's too late .  i 've already ruined my life . 
you will survive this .  .  .  donald .  i promise you that you will survive .  you must let me help you .   and when i clap my hands together you will wake up . 
thank you . 
donald an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a god .  you are an agnostic .  an agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of god .  .  .  but does not deny the possibility that god exists . 
goodbye dr .  thurman . 
goodbye donald .

it smells funny .  like gasoline .

yeah . 
i wonder how she 's gonna fix that one . 
oh lester .  he loves his weather y 'know . 
hey ya like it ?  open it .  .  .  yah  the globe .  pull at the equator there . 
we 're not in the showroom dear . 
oh all right  how soon they forget where all this comes from . 
perhaps he will listen to you .  .  . 
yes please two . 
one or two ? 
two please . 
oh ? 
how lovely . 
i 've always thought that myself . 
oh yes . 
she has the face of an angel .  .  .  she was an angel .  she was so kind .  .  .  so kind to me .  it 's not her fault for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant .  i 'm sure i must have been a great disappointment to her . 
oh no mr .  merrick .  no .  no son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment . 
if only i could find her .  if only she could see me now here with such lovely kind friends .  you mrs .  treves and you mr .  treves .  then maybe she would love me as i am .  i 've tried to hard to be good . 
i 'll join you shortly . 
yes very well i think .  are the girls in bed ? 
yes and they send their kisses .  would you like your sherry now ? 
no i think a whiskey . 
i should n't be .  we made great progress today .  i taught him to repeat a few basic phrases .  he did rather well too but i had to lead him every step of the way .  though frankly at times i was unsure of who was leading whom . 
what do you mean ? 
well i was n't sure whether he was parroting me because that 's all he was capable of or whether he sensed that that 's all i wanted to hear and he was trying to please me . 
but i thought you said that he was rather .  .  .  simple ? 
he is .  i mean i 've always thought he was .  i think he must be .  is he simple ?  or is that just something i 've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself ? 
i do n't know .  i ca n't explain it .  if this is an intelligent man trapped in the body of a monster then i 'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind free that spirit as best i can to help him live as full and content a life as possible .  but !  if he 's an imbecile who 's body i ca n't treat and who 's mind i ca n't touch well then my obligation is discharged .  they can put him where they will he wo n't be bothered i wo n't be bothered and everyone 's conscience can remain free and untroubled .  and that is my dilemma .  .  .  what is in his mind ? 
john .  .  .  .  how can you ever forgive me ? 
oh no i could n't . 
it 's for you john .  it 's all for you .  go ahead let them see you . 
yes very soon . 
splendid .  it 's truly a masterpiece .  well i suppose i 'll be on my way now .  i hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening . 
oh yes !  it was wonderful ! 
i 'm glad john .  goodnight . 
mr .  treves tell me .  .  .  tell me truly .  is it alright did i make any mistakes that you can see ? 
no john not one that i can see . 
then i should n't change anything ? 
no no i would n't change a thing . 
you too my friend .  goodnight . 
fine . 
good .  excellent .  now then mrs .  mothershead i want you to come into this room with me .  inside there is a man with a rather .  .  .  unfortunate appearance . 
i 've heard . 
yes .  .  .  well i want you to clear up a little mess a breakfast tray was spilt .  and bring up another breakfast .  when you 've done that you and i shall give the man a bath .  but mothershead i 'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this above all do not scream do not cry out or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him .  .  . 
sir you do n't have to worry about me .  i 'm not the sort to cry out .  shall we go in ? 
yes .  .  .  yes let 's go in . 
yes !  the workhouse ! 
not quite yet mrs .  mothershead .  there seems to be some difficulty this morning . 
no he 's very upset about something . 
just being obstinate sir .  i 'll handle it . 
perhaps you 've got the time for that mr .  treves i certainly do n't .  i 've got an entire hospital to look after and you have your real patients .  do n't waste your time with him sir it 's like talking to a wall .  i do n't mean to be harsh but truthfully what can you do for him ?  i 'll be back later for his bath .  and mr .  carr gomm would like to see you when you have a moment .  good day sir . 
sorry . 
sorry ! 
make your mind up . 
you may need a real berserk . 
shut up .  you there .  you there and you there . 
row ! 
the sun !  that 's it ! 
what magic ? 
i 've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight . 
you 'll see ! 
look out ! 
i did .  you said things were fine . 
i remember . 
this is the night you met clementine joel .  i remember watching you walk down the beach with her and i thought oh shit . 
yeah you told me that later . 
i told you that later . 
no one . 
anyhoo sweetie i done a bad thing .  i kinda sorta wrecked your car .  .  . 
but i do n't know maybe we 're the normal ones y 'know ?  i mean what kind of people do well at this stuff ? 
and i just liked you so much . 
you did ?  you liked me ? 
hi joel .  so no jokes about my name ? 
yeah hi i have a one o 'clock with dr .  mierzwiak .  clementine kruczynski . 
yes please have a seat .  he 'll be right with you .

i really want to but tonight 's important .  test tomorrow . 
what if ? 
joel come here .  please .

oh um .  .  . 
because i just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now . 
that 's okay .  i 
i 'm sorry .  i just wanted to say that .  this seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and 
hey joel 
 and i 'm just too nervous around you right now . 
i 'm nervous too . 
yeah ?  i would n't have thought that . 
well you obviously do n't know me . 
i 'm nervous because i have and enormous crush on you . 
says you were a bully .  .  . 
a bully ?  moi ? 
that 's what it says .  you drank too much you picked on me for being passive and timid . 
well sounds like me .  sorry man .   says you were jealous and suspicious . 
says you would sometimes disappear all night then brag to me about your sexual conquests . 
did i use the term sexual conquests or is that your way of putting it . 
i do n't know . 
does n't sound like me . 
says you were a slob leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake . 
says you were constantly calling me a slob .   it 's sexy that we were like a married couple griping and overlyfamiliar and bored .  do n't you think ? 
i sort of do .  but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality .  cleaned up enough to be erotic . 
we should have sex .  it 's old hat for us . 
i ca n't stop thinking about you . 
yay .  meet me after work by the old mill . 
what old mill ?  is that somewhere we 
i just wanted to say that .  come by my house . 
i just walked in . 
hmmm .  do you miss me ? 
oddly enough i do . 
ha ha !  you said i do .  i guess that means we 're married . 
i guess so . 
tomorrow night .  .  .  honeymoon on ice . 
did you send this ?  is it a joke ? 
i probably got the same thing as you . 
i mean i have n't even told anyone i 've met you .  who would even know to do this ? 
maybe it 's true then .  it 's my voice on the tape . 
that 's what you have to say ?  how could it be true ?  i never even heard of any procedure like this .  it 's a joke . 
i know .  i spoke to my friend magda . 
joel we 've fucked .  we 've made love .  like a million times .  and we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night .  is n't that lovely ? 
hey lover .  whatcha doing ? 
i 'm just y 'know passing the time best i can till i can see you . 
god i ca n't believe i ever hated you . 
you must have been crazy . 
guess what i 'm wearing . 
i do n't know .  panties and 
your dried cum . 
jesus . 
i know who you are . 
oh ?  well there 's been some trouble on the ranch .  i came up here to get out of the way .  it 's so dark now i doubt if i could find my way back down .  if you could help .  .  . 
save your breath for the climb . 
neither do i .  .  .  ha ha ho ho hee hee . 
clockworks . 
clockworks ? 
siwash huh ? 
he was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this faraway siwash ridge .  i came to the dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own . 
the clock people ? 
then if you are japanese then why are you called the chink ? 
the clock people mistook me for chinese .  and the name stuck .  in the same way that all indian tribes came to be labeled indians through the ignorance of an italian sailor with a taste for oranges it is only fitting that indians misnamed me .  the clock people however are not a tribe rather they are a gathering of indians from various tribes .  they have lived together since 1906 . 
ha ha ho ho and hee hee . 
yes everything is getting worse .  but everything is also getting better . 
the countess has come to our aid .  the rubber rose ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls .  and i have been asked to oversee the ranch .  for 300 a week .  and as it turns out the countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was .  .  .  here 's a picture ! 
she had a one wayticket to kansas city . 
you mean she 's dead ? 
easy come easy go . 
that 's the second containment seal .  beyond that engineering . 
i 'm going in . 
start the countdown . 
yes sir ! 
almost done i just gotta check one thing .  .  . 
justin . 
skipper you gotta help me .  .  . 
you 're not going to die !  not today !  i want you to do exactly as i say and i 'm gonna get you out of there alright ? 
but i ca n't .  .  .  i gotta get out of here .  .  .  skipper please .  .  . 
justin .  i wo n't let you die . 
dr .  weir admiral hollis would like to see you as soon as possible . 
i designed the ship 's propulsion system .  i am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive .  you ca n't send a search and rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed .  that would be like .  .  .  like sending an auto mechanic to work on the shuttle . 
i can understand your desire to redeem your reputation dr .  weir but it does n't factor into this . 
this is not about my reputation !  this is not about me at all !   the event horizon was created for one reason to go faster than light .  imagine mankind exploring new solar systems colonizing new worlds .  seven years ago we did n't just lose the ship and the crew .  we lost the dream .   i have to go . 
the crew ?  could they still be alive ? 
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months .  they 're been gone seven years . 
someone sent that message .  admiral you have to put me on that ship . 
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers .   good for four months . 
i put in for a replacement for you but no one .  .  . 
no no its alright .  i talked to my ex he 'll keep denny over christmas and i 'll get him this summer .   goddam it skipper .  .  .  i have n't seen him in two months . 
i am sorry .  but now we have to go to work . 
you better hurry .  he 's engaged the override we ca n't open the inner door . 
five seconds . 
whatever was on that bridge was n't weir . 
we 've got to shut it down we 've got to .  .  . 
blow it up ? 
we blow the corridor .  use the foredecks as a lifeboat separate it from the rest of the ship .  we stay put .  .  . 
no .  i 'll be right back . 
 .  .  . repeat we 're armed .  .  . 
miller he 's back he was in the tank .  .  . 
he 's dead .  .  . 
yes . 
he 's been past mars ? 
he served on the goliath . 
was n't that ship destroyed ? 
they attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for titan .  the shuttle 's ohtwo tanks ruptured during the rescue flooded both ships with pure oxygen .  there was a spark and both ships were incinerated .  the skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat .  captain miller was able .  .  . 
yeah .   you do n't wanna know the details . 
ben i 'm afraid i 've got to ask 
not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your 
okay .  we 'll skip that question . 
this is n't permanent johnny .  we need to be careful until we 're normal again . 
oh you remember my name do you ?  you happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body ? 
we 're working as hard as we can 
yeah .  i can tell .  victor was right . 
ben i do n't know if this thing 'll change us back or make us worse .  i need you to be patient for a little while longe
got it teach . 
forget it egghead .  i 'm good as is . 
actually the engines are smes .  hydrogenbase carbon propellant .  couple generations past your last ride .   i 'm not as dumb as you look . 
keep talking there wo n't be a next time . 
'course not .  strictly business . 
yeah well his eyes say different . 
hey two hearts got busted last time .  maybe she 's not over it either . 
let 's see you got victor stud of the year more coin than god ?  or reed the world 's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp .  hmmm it 's a tossup . 
put your tiny little mind at ease . 
do n't you wander off boy . 
back on earth .  victor 's medical facility .  .  .  we 're in quarantine . 
reed ?  .  .  .  sue ? 
they 're fine .  everybody else .  .  .  is fine . 
sure . 
get a grip .  reed .  we did n't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch .  just close the shields .  .  . 
ben's still out there 
so reel him in .  but we came here to do a job .  so let 's do it .  quickly . 
reed we 're running out of time . 
it 's too late for him and soon it 'll be too late for all of us . 
ben did this . 
ben did this ? 
he 's had some kind of .  .  .  reaction to exposure from the cloud .  and he 's not the only one . 
not much .  we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage . 
i ruined ?  with all due respect i told you to abort 
abort ?  reed i put my company my name billions of dollars on the line and i will not let you make me look like a fool 
victor if we could understand what happened to us 
i do n't want to understand it .  this is n't one of your science projects .  i just want to fix it .  fast ! 
what i should have done a long time ago .  applications and patents reed .  this all belongs to me . 
which is precisely the point .  analysis is over .  it 's time for action .  my men could have massproduced this by now . 
i think you both know my director of genetic research susan storm . 
and they do n't call my parents ? 
not if you 're over sixteen . 
okay .  thanks a lot linda . 
and do n't let them talk you into a diaphragm either . 
outrageous merv .  nice to be here .  i feel great . 
i was going to say .  .  .  your eyes look a little red . 
i 've been swimming merv . 
i wanted to talk a little bit about school if i could .  .  . 
school .   school is no problem .  all you have to do is go to get the grades .  and if you know something all you have to do is go about half the time . 
how often do you go ? 
i do n't go at all . 
well it pretty much speaks for itself .  peter you want to run with it ? 
fascinating . 
that 's me merv . 
totally . 
merv i 'm thinking .  .  .  i 've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards . 
i thought he was out of town . 
he is . 
then do n't hassle it . 
naw .  any good ? 
suzanne somers' tits . 
all right . 
i like sex . 
righto ! 
listen you fuzzy little shithead  i 've been fucked around in my time by a fairly good crosssection of meantempered rulecrazy cops and now it 's my turn .  fuck you officer i 'm in charge here and i 'm telling you we do n't have room for you . 
my bags are out there in that white cadillac convertible .  can you have someone drive it around to the room ? 
do n't worry about a thing sir .  just enjoy your stay . 
well thank you . 
ah yes .  mr .  duke ?  you have one message call lucy at the americana hotel room 1600 . 
holy shit ! 
what ?   what was that crazy bitch said to him ?   there 's a war on man !  people are being killed ! 
killed ? 
in vietnam !  on the goddamn television ! 
oh .  .  .  yes .  .  .  yes .  .  .  this terrible war .  when will it end ? 
tell me .  what do you want ? 
crying ?  why was she crying ? 
well uh .  she did n't say mr .  duke .  but since i know you 're here with the police convention .  .  . 
look you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again .  we 're watching her very carefully .  .  .  this woman has been into laudanum .  it 's a controlled experiment but i suspect we 'll need your cooperation before this thing is over . 
well certainly .  .  .  we 're always happy to cooperate with the police .  .  . 
do n't worry .  you 're protected .  just treat this poor woman like you 'd treat any other human being in trouble . 
what ?  ah .  .  .  yes yes i see what you mean .  .  .  yes .  .  .  so you 'll be responsible then ? 
of course .  and now i have to get back to the news .  send up some ice . 
you 're another one of these california boys .  your friend here 's been tellin' us about dope fiends . 
they 're everywhere .  nobody 's safe .  and sure as hell not in the south .  they like warm weather .  .  .  you 'd never believe it .  in l . a .  it 's out of control .  first it was drugs now it 's witchcraft . 
witchcraft ?  shit you ca n't mean it !

fifteen . 
address ? 
just put me down as a avg  a vagrant vagabond .  come on this is a joke !  assault and battery ?  i barely touched that bitch ! 
occupation ? 
you can always come see it in london . 
only if you were in it .  are you ? 
i would n't miss it . 
boy i 'd love to .  .  .  but i 'm going to hollywood . 
are you an actor ? 
hell yes !  .  .  .  well okay i 'm still in school .  but as soon as i graduate .  .  .  california here i come ! 
are you really serious ?  about acting ? 
why .  .  .  yes . 
then do n't go to hollywood .

i 'm telling you straight if you have any serious ambitions stay clear of the place .  it 'll crush you . 
you sound as if you hate it . 
no i do n't hate it . 
 .  .  . not if i can help it . 
gosh !  you 'll break a lot of hearts . 
they 'll mend . 
what about your husband ? 
will you be getting back together ?  when you quit hollywood i mean . 
what is this ? 
why you .  .  .  you little bastard ! 
you 're wasting your time lady .  nothing 's off the record with me . 
please sit down .  .  . 
you may discuss my predicament doctor .  you may discuss it with anyone you like but not with me .  i 'm not interested .  i can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian . 
i see . 
besides i do n't want to be what you want to make me . 
and what 's that ? 
normal .  average . 
all right .  will you please sit down now ?   symington says . 
 .  .  . did you really say that ? 
just a little joke miss farmer . 
this whole thing is a joke ! 
stay calm please . 
no you stay calm doctor !  but you 're finding that difficult are n't you ?   why are you attracted to me ?  perhaps later in some of our more intimate sessions .  .  .  after we know each other a little better .  .  .   and you 've torn my personality to shreds and i 'm weeping and vulnerable .  .  .   then you 'll really get your kicks wo n't you doctor ? 
i 'll have someone show you to your room . 
oh that 's good very professional .  in control .  but the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away . 
you did n't say symington says' . 
yes .  it was very good to see her . 
really ?  any problems ? 
you 're telling me you feel guilty . 
no .  .  .  what i mean is .  .  .  i 'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life that 's all . 
do you really believe your mother 's trying to kill you ? 
what ? 
she told me you said mama you want to kill me . 
i never said .  .  .  oh look .  that 's just a figure of speech .  she said something funny and i said .  .  . 
and you accused her of tampering with your mail . 
oh for christ 's .  .  . 
but you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative .  whom do you think i should believe ? 
doctor i hate to break this to you but my mother is a little batty . 
frances you 're still filled with anxiety .  you feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends .  consequently i did n't recommend your release at the staff review . 
you what ? 
mental illness is an elusive thing and though i 'm pleased you 're feeling more .  .  .  capable it 's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time .  do n't you agree ? 
dr .  symington how big is your dick ? 
huh ? 
'cause if it 's long enough which i doubt why do n't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass ! 
frances i 'm warning you .  .  . 
no i 'm warning you !  who do you think you are god ?  you bumble around with your folders .  .  .    .  .  . and your pencils .  .  .    .  .  . and your goddamn buttons .  .  .    .  .  . all your badges of authority !  but you have no authority !  you 're nothing !  you 're a zero ! 
sedate her . 
no ! 
is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future and the future of your children ? 
no ! 
is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country ? 
no !  no ! 
good !  because brothers that 's you ! 
yeah ? 
i checked the files .  this one holds the record for shock treatments .  four hundred seventeen and no end in sight . 
you 're kidding . 
yeah well you know doctors .  they sure hate to use that word . 
what ? 
'incurable . '
who are you ? 
my name is frankenstein .  .  . 
it will be all right .  i 'll take care of you . 
jack ?  marcie ?  ned ? 
no no they 're all dead .  .  . 
bill  bill  bill is out there .  .  . 
i will protect you . 
maybe we should wait for mr .  christy . 
i do n't know .  marcie 's got me paranoid . 
tomorrow is another day . 
right !  right ! 
i was careless . 
give them a little while longer .  it 's still early anyway . 
i guess .  .  . 
i said new this is an '90 . 
it 's hardly been used at all .  i got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years .  swear to god .  that 's like new . 
so do i just follow you ? 
yeah follow us . 
so let 's do it . 
vamanos ! 
stop ?  we 're not going to actually stop at a motel are we ? 
the truth hurts . 
i 'm exhausted . 
lie in the back dad i 'll drive us into mexico . 
i have no idea . 
i 'm gonna try and get us across the border . 
no dad you gotta tell em that they 're back there . 
they 're gonna kill us .  they get us across the border they 're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us . 
if they get over the border they 're gonna let us go . 
dad i watch those reality shows .  they never let anybody go .  any cop will tell you in a situation like this you get a chance you go for it .  this is our chance . 
what about kate ? 
they 're gonna kill her anyway .  at least now with all these cops we 've got a fighting chance . 
son i have this situation under control .  i know exactly what i 'm doing .  you 're going to have to trust me on this . 
if trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers i ca n't do that .  if you do n't tell the cops i will . 
he 's running the show . 
i 'm running the show .  i make the plays and you back the plays i make .  stop thinking with your fucking balls .  kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ai n't the time to go for it .  i need your cover .  cover my ass . 
it 's not suicide if you 're already dead .  two .  .  .

it seems the men could n't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs .   israeli men would linger over wounded females  often to the detriment of the mission often endangering their own lives .   they do n't use women anymore . 
sir someone mentioned you received the navy cross .   may i ask what you got it for ? 
for pulling a 210pound man out of a burning barrack in saudi arabia . 
i see .   so when a man tries to rescue another man he 's a hero .  but when he tries to rescue a woman he 's gone soft . 
could you have pulled that 210pound man clear lieutenant ? 
it also seems like a problem with the men's attitude sir .   so maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead . 
they are with me ! 
you 're fast . 
that is our job . 
well your people are getting in the way of my job . 
major what do you think could have done this ? 
get your people out of there or i will . 
it 's tatopoulos . 
right .  the worm guy .   can someone get those people off the beach ? 
excuse me would you mind telling me what the hell i 'm doing here ? 
follow me . 
we have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise . 
we know . 
yeah you 're the worm guy . 
the radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm 's dna !  you have any idea what that means ? 
no but i have the feeling i 'm about to find out . 
it means that due to a man made accident the chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before .  mutated by seventeen percent ? 
they 're enormous !  a new species created by man's recklessness .  that 's what i 've been trying to tell you i 'm only a biologist .  i take radioactive samples and study them . 
then you 're perfect .   here 's your radioactive sample .  study it . 
you 're standing on it . 
that 's right . 
but there 's no animal in the world that can make prints like that ?  is there ? 
we 're hoping you 're going to help us figure that out . 
it happened so fast no one knew what hit them til is was over . 
up . 
what ?   up ? 
berithium lava coming through .  use the handholds above you . 
raise the glass and push the blue button . 
that 's it ? 
yeah .  what 's wrong ?  jason othino .  i ust oncuont ot wouo oc oomooooateo onan onat . 
we 're getting major structural damage . 
yes ? 
what 's the weather like outside ? 
there is no weather in space . 
i never get tired of that joke . 
guys we 're sustaining structural damage !  .  .  . 
the enemy is matching velocity . 
the beryllium sphere has fractured under stress . 
it 's fractured .  .  . 
we need another one . 
no we do n't have an extra beryllium sphere . 
all systems are working commander . 
home . 
you .  .  .  you mean earth ? 
yeah .  earth .  time to get back to earth kids . 
right .  long live .  .  .  what 's your planet ? 
theramin . 
long live theramini .   take a left here ? 
but what if sarris survives ? 
oh i do n't think so .  i gave him both barrels . 
he has a very powerful ship .  perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of
i would but i am really running late and the 134 's a parking lot after 200 .   but listen the guy gives you any more trouble just give a call .  .  . 
thanks
it was a lot of fun .  you kids are great . 
it 's perfectly safe .  i promise . 
 .  .  .  maintenance facility .  .  . 
wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars we 'll be there this fine ship this fine crew .  never give up never surrender ! 
no thank god he has not . 
then how did he find out about the device ? 
our former commander was not .  .  .  strong . 
former commander ? 
i 'm sorry .  you deserve to be shown . 
mathesar i need you to prepare pods for my crew . 
it 's the tothian mine field left standing from the great war of 12185 . 
you what ?  .  .  what are you talking about ? 
we have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations .  the fault must lie with us with the ship .  .  . 
of course the army will acquit him that 's not the point .  .  .  arnold is a man and will understand .   what i need to understand is john sam .  .  .  what is happening here ?   who are those people in there ?   the fat ones in silk ? 
they are .  .  .  friends of congress . 
is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went ? 
he 's from virginia  there is no more classist elitist .  .  .  english place on earth than virginia .   and what in hell has he done for our cause ?   washington has been preaching compromise compromise compromise !   hancock acts he led the boston tea party !   that 's why new england loves him . 
hancock led the boston tea party' because he 's a goddamned tea smuggler !   he was n't protesting inequality he was eliminating competition .   now you listen to me  we need to get a southerner elected commanderinchief or the south will not fight !   what have we been struggling for all these years ?   for this moment !   and if we fail now remember  you stopped us ! 
i tell you every damned place i go the man is adored !   general washington !   champion of trenton !  savior of the republic !   and you should hear the way people are deprecating congress ! 
makes you gag . 
gag on your own invention then . 
oh come now .  .  . 
you invented this this .  .  . 
he has the soul of an aristocrat who 'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people ! 
finally !  ?   it 's people like these who as soon as they get a little power want more and more .   more ale here ! 
again just to touch on a touchy subject but .  .  .  would the people accept another leader over washington ? 
it 's the political cost of doing business' george . 
if he is n't then he 's stupid . 
these men have suffered but i believe they will fight . 
i hear general lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in new york  why wo n't he come on !  ? 
general lee is detained captain .  .  . 
detained by what ? 
the british army sir ! 
the british army is right back there across that river !   sir !   i think it must be something else that detains general lee . 
we already have black soldiers in our army .  .  . 
unofficially general greene . 
what 's the difference ? 
i have to ask you for that key . 
what the setup did n't work so you want the key back ? 
catlett says if you do n't open the locker the deal 's off . 
you serious ?  this is how you guys do business ?  i ca n't believe you are n't dead . 
i do n't need a gun .  where is it ?  if it is n't on you it 's around here someplace .

well i do n't know .  i gave the man his money sent him on his way . 
you gave him the money ? 
i gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it . 
now why would you do that ?  put the money in a locker ? 
because there were a zillion dea guys hanging around the terminal . 
a zillion huh ?  that 's a lot . 
where 's your partner the jumpy one ?  why is n't he here ? 
he 's around someplace . 
i hear he 's around palm springs .  dealing our product .  product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars .   why do you keep talking to me bullshit ?  i think maybe i have ramon and ceasar staple your tongue to your chin .  what do you think ? 
i went to uc san diego .   we 're gonna spend the weekend at the universal sheraton .  we 're gonna take the tour .  see the shark .  check out the miami vice action spectacular .  after we 'll come here get our money . 
harry let me answer that . 
you can talk to me . 
that 's what i thought .  so let me put it this way .  .  . 
twenty seven hundred . 
exactly .  you either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket i do n't give a fuck .  you do n't ever hand me a book with a miss in it . 
you know marty you were good in the cyclone . 
martin .  it was a beautiful role .  all i had to do was find the character 's center the stem i 'd used to wind him up and he 'd play man he 'd play . 
a few weeks before shooting i went back to bensonhurst just to listen to you guys .  see i 'm italian but i grew up in tarzana .  so i wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech . 
we talk different ? 
it 's more like your attitude .  your tone your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves in your opinions your indifference to conventional views . 
you mean like we do n't give a shit . 
yeah .  kinda .  anyway once i have the authentic sounds of speech the rhythms man the patois i can actually begin to think the way those guys do get inside their heads . 
no i do n't .  though i have to say i 'm curious . 
so you want to know . 
if you 'd like to tell me yeah . 
i 'm thinking of a movie . 
one of mine ? 
one we 're producing . 
with what ?  wiseguy money ? 
what happened ?  the pressure got to you ? 
pressure ?  i 'm the one applied the pressure . 
martin look at me . 
i 'm looking at you . 
like this ? 
what you 're telling me you 're tired ?  you wanna go to bed ? 
wait .  how about this ? 
now you 're squinting like you need glasses . 
that 's not bad . 
that 's what i think of you asshole .  nothing . 
i believe it . 
i turn it on when i confront the guy . 
yeah but you have n't found him yet .   the guy took off for las vegas . 
how do i know that ? 
goodlooking too .   like karen . 
it 's not that simple .  you have to be careful .  there 's another guy that comes along a hardon you owe some money to .  a mob guy .  wants to take you out anyway on account of a past situation . 
okay .  i 'm listening . 
yeah a ship that 's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago .  you do n't think that 's just a little freaky ? 
take it easy dodge .  it 's only a piece of metal . 
damn mind of it 's own . 
morning skipper . 
looks like it took out the backup genny too . 
it 's a beautiful country .  very clean .  very civilized .  and cold . 
we 'll see who 's dreamin' m 'man . 
she 's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we 'd never know it . 
yeah .  hell what difference does it make if we report it now or later ?  we call this in now gonna be coastguard fbi who knows who all over the place . 
i ai n't no mechanic just so you know . 
you find anything that even looks like a compressor .  i do n't care what grab it . 
i do n't know .  tuesday ? 
wrong .  it 's friday . 
maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat . 
some charts .  a crew manifest .   looks like her last voyage was january 1953 .  the question is where the hell 's she been since . 
she was sailing up north right ? 
her destination was halifax yeah . 
well suppose she got a little further north than she should have .   got stuck in the ice .  the passengers and crew evacuated .  she froze into the ice pack which moved further north where it froze in solid .  they write it off .  fifty years later the whole global warming thing happens .  the ice melts she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her . 
nope . 
she was a twomasted brig boat sailing out of new york in 1872 .   one day she was sighted off the coast of portugal by a merchant vessel the dei gratia .  as the crew of the dei gratia got closer they discovered that no one was at the helm of the mary celeste .  on boarding they found her completely deserted .  the captain his wife their daughter and the entire crew all gone .  the last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble .  the table was even set for dinner .  and in the nine days after the last entry she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard . 
so what did happen ? 
nobody knows .  there 've been a lot of theories of course .  but we 'll never really know for sure . 
you think she 's sailing without a crew ? 
you 're more practical than superstitious . 
only way to be . 
maybe .  but there 's always somebody whose interest 's at stake . 
for now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this . 
did you see him ? 
who ? 
the guy .  he just came this way . 
what guy ? 
there 's somebody else on this boat . 
what ?  what the hell 're you talking about . 
i saw him .  just a minute ago .  some guy . 
are you sure ? 
of course i 'm sure .  i saw him . 
you sure it was n't me ? 
it was n't you .  it was somebody else .  there 's somebody else aboard . 
we do n't exactly have the best bargaining position . 
dodge get on that turbine .  i do n't care if you do n't sleep for a week .  the sooner you 're done the sooner we can get out of here .  how 's the food situation ? 
no cowboy shit .  right . 
yup . 
please tell me it is n't that teenager ! 
enid and i were just friends .  you know .  .  .  we feel comfortable around each other .  .  .  she really likes my old records and .  .  . 
i ca n't believe this !  i thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me ! 
enid .  it 's sort of like a diary i guess . 
it 's supposed to be don knotts . 
and what was your reason for choosing him as your subject ? 
i dunno .  .  .  i just like don knotts . 
i see .  .  .  interesting .  .  . 
well i got the idea when i was doing some research and i discovered that cook 's chicken used to be called coon's chicken and so i decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism .  .  .  and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture .  .  . 
did you actually do this painting ? 
well no  it 's more like a found art object . 
and how do you think this addresses the subject of racism ? 
it 's complicated .  .  .  i guess i 'm trying to show how racism used to  more out in the open and now it 's hidden or something .  .  . 
and how does an image like this help us to see that ? 
i 'm not sure .  .  .  i mean .  .  .   i guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it 's so shocking ? 
uhoh . 
do n't worry  it 's nothing bad .  i was just wondering what your plans were for next year ? 
i 'm not really sure  working i guess .  .  . 
well i know this is really short notice but i got a call from a very close friend at the academy of art  design and she tells me that i 'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program .  .  .  and well i hope you do n't mind enid but i took the liberty of submitting your name . 
as far as i know it includes housing and meals and everything .  .  .  it is really quite an offer .  .  . 
 .  .  . wow .  .  . 
so what do you think ? 
i dunno .  .  .  would i have to take classes and stuff ? 
well yes .  .  . 
i .  .  . 
let me know as soon as you can enid .  this could be a great thing for you . 
what do you mean ? 
the whole business with the art show and the newspaper  it 's absolutely 
huh ? 
did n't principal jaffee call you ? 
i did n't check my messages .  .  . 
oh my goodness .  .  .  well the whole thing is just ridiculous and as soon as the school board is back in session next fall i 'm going to do everything i can to help you . 
help me what ? 
well they 're forcing me to give you a nonpassing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition .  .  .  but do n't worry  i 'm sure i 'll be able to get you your diploma in the fall ! 
but .  .  .  can i still get that scholarship to the art academy ? 
i 'm sorry enid  you have to be an official high school graduate before i can nominate you .   i had to give it to someone else .  .  .   but i 'm sure next year i can 
you can count on me sir ! 
why ?  what difference does it make ?  you already got his money .  .  . 
look that 's the policy .  .  .  if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater .  .  . 
but i was only trying to be friendly .  .  . 
look we do n't pay you to be a movie critic  just do your job . 
okay okay .  .  .  i wo n't say a word .  .  . 
what ?  i 'm just kidding around with the customers .  .  .  it 's my shtick ! 
well lose it !  and why are n't you pushing the large sizes ?  did n't you get training about upsizing ? 
but i feel weird .  .  .  it 's so sleazy . 
it 's not optional ! 
jesus .  .  . 
go ahead .  .  . 
no really .  .  . 
god you 're really obsessed .  .  . 
i am not  i just think it 'd be funny to see what he 'd do .  .  . 
i thought we decided that josh was way too cool to be interested in sex and that he 's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that .  .  . 
yeah but maybe one of us should at least try .  .  . 
no matter what happened it would be a big disaster .  .  .  let 's just try and keep everything the way it is . 
i ca n't afford stuff like this right now . 
i 'm sick of waiting  we need to start getting stuff if we 're ever going to move .   are n't these the greatest towels ? 
why do you care about this kind of stuff ? 
do n't you want nice stuff ? 
i ca n't imagine spending money on towels . 
you do n't have to .  i 'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job . 
you 're insane . 
do you still want to go to that thing tonight ? 
what thing ? 
that guy 's band is playing tonight .  .  .  alien autopsy . 
oh yeah .  .  .  maybe .  .  .  seymour 's going on his big date tonight and i kind of want to be around when he calls so i can hear how bad it went . 
god i 'm so sick of seymour . 
do you still want to do something tonight ? 
what happened to seymour ? 
i ca n't believe it  he actually scored ! 
how repulsive ! 
so should i come over ? 
actually i 'm just about to go out with some friends .  .  . 
what are you talking about ?  who ? 
just some people from work .  .  . 
i do n't believe you . 
yeah well you said you were busy .  .  .  look i 'd better get going .  .  .  i 'll call you tomorrow . 
it 's a totally normal average neighborhood ! 
i just mean it 's weird to me .  .  .  i 've never been anywhere near here in my life . 
josh says this is a really good neighborhood .  .  . 
what ?  when did you see josh ?  ! 
he came into work . 
why ?  what did he say ? 
nothing . 
when was this ? 
i do n't know !  god do n't act so jealous i only talked to him for two minutes . 
great .  .  . 
what ?  !  it looks totally normal .  .  .  what 's wrong with it ? 
i said great .  .  . 
oh yeah i can tell you really love it ! 
well what am i supposed to say ?  i ca n't wait to live in some depressing shithole in the middle of nowhere ?  ! 
there 's something wrong with every single place we look at !  why do n't you just come right out and tell me you do n't want to move in with me ?  ! 
because you 'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it . 
you 're the one who 's still living out some stupid seventhgrade fantasy ! 
fuck you !  have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life ! 
i need to talk to you . 
i do n't know .  .  .  i was thinking maybe i should live alone .  i decided to rent that place we looked at .  i 'm moving in next week . 
please let me come with you .  please please please .  .  . 
i do n't know  i 'm not sure it 's a good idea . 
of course it 's a good idea .  .  .  it 's our plan . 
but how are you gonna pay rent and everything ?  you do n't even have a job . 
i 'll get a job tomorrow i promise .  if i do n't you can totally tell me to fuck off . 
it 's fine . 
so where 's all your stuff ? 
that 's all you 're bringing ? 
i 'm gonna finish packing tonight .  .  .  i 'll bring it over tomorrow sometime . 
what time ? 
i dunno .  .  . 
make sure you 're here by noon  we have tons of stuff to do .  .  .  oh yeah !  i have to show you something else ! 
he 'll replace you too that 's all you really care about . 
you think so ?  fine .   it 's best you get out .  go .  tell all your people to go run home where they 'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here they were the only ones to flee 
as are they all . 
that 's ridiculous talk and you ca n't seriously believe it
now you 're telling me my beliefs ?  i do n't think so
at last you 're right we do you are the problem in tsavo

nowhere  fast .   why do n't you lock up and buy me a sub ? 
uh i ca n't .   i 'm kind of working on something . 
oh just checking something for an old friend . 
who ? 
who ?   just  someone we know . 
oh ray 
aaah !   nobody !   i ca n't tell you ! 
who ray ? 
dana !   dana barrett ! 
it 's an interesting one pete .   if anything was going on it 's totally subdued now . 
egon and i have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in gevs  giga electron volts . 
hey hey hey stresshound !   are you nuts ?  if anybody found out about this we 'd be in serious trouble .   the judge could n't have been clearer  no ghostbusting . 
relax .   we 're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet low key no profile . 
okay let 's heat em up ! 
i 'm walter peck .   i represent the environmental protection agency third district . 
great !   how 's it going ? 
are you peter venkman ? 
yes i 'm doctor venkman . 
i have ph . d 's in psychology and parapsychology . 
i see .   and now you catch ghosts ? 
you could say that . 
and how many ghosts have you caught mr .  venkman ? 
i 'm not at liberty to say . 
and where do you put these ghosts once you catch them ? 
in a storage facility . 
and would this storage facility be located on these premises ? 
yes it would . 
and may i see this storage facility ? 
no you may not . 
and why not mr .  venkman ? 
because you did n't say the magic word . 
and what is the magic word mr .  venkman ? 
the magic word is please . 
why do you want to see it ? 
well because i 'm curious .   i want to know more about what you do here .   frankly there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation .  for instance the storage of noxious possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement .   now either you show me what 's down there or i come back with a court order . 
go ahead !   get a court order .   then i 'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution . 
have it your way mr .  venkman . 
hey !   make yourself useful !   go save a tree ! 
forget it venkman .   you had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me .   now it 's my turn smartass . 
see !   they are using drugs . 
probably a mixture of gases no doubt stolen from the army  .  .  . 
that 's peck ! 
 .  .  .  or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really biblical proportions . 
a square ? 
good guess  but no . 
close  but definitely wrong . 
yes .   i do n't like this . 
well just 75 more to go .   what 's this one ? 
two wavy lines ? 
sorry .   this is n't your day . 
on what charge ? 
if you set me free i will find my way back to the army march on rome and depose you .   then the army and i will restore the republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again . 
quintus will tell the army that you are being called to rome to celebrate your victory .   they will hear that you are living in luxury .  he will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life .  and soon the army wo n't even remember your name . 
how can they ?   who else is there ?   i have no heir .  .  . 
ignore that ?  !   the sooner we leave this disgusting place the better . 
at least stay for the running of the animals .   you are paying for it you know .  .  . 
until your confirmation date . 
at the opening of the month of janus i will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship .  .  . 
yes .   you know that 's not a bad idea . 
maybe it 'll crush gaius . 
i 'm serious . 
so am i . 
we can crush gaius another way .  what if you do throw something to the people they really want ?   make them a gift of food . 
give away food ? 
sacks of grain even bread .   i own the grain licenses for the military i can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the danube . 
take grain away from the army ? 
make a gift to the people .   it 's your money anyway so it 's only fair . 
i would n't know who to bet on . 
i 'm certain father will be in better humors by then .   now honor us with your presence at dinner .   i 'll join you as soon as i see my father 's physician . 
let 's get out of here elaine .  let 's go somewhere else . 
benjamin  do they know you ? 
of course not . 
i do n't know .  they must think i look like this guy gladstone . 
yes . 
you 're the first  you 're the first thing for so long that i 've liked .  the first person i could stand to be with . 
it just happened .  it was just this thing that happened along with everything else .  can you understand that ? 
yes .

yes .  she had a husband and a son . 
did they ever find out ? 
no . 
and it 's all over now . 
yes .

yes  i think that would be good . 
i 'll be up in five minutes .

benjamin  do you find me undesirable ? 
oh no mrs .  robinson .  i think  i think you 're the most attractive of all my parents' friends .  i just do n't think we could possibly 
are you afraid of me ? 
no  but look  maybe we could do something else together mrs .  robinson  would you like to go to a movie . 
benjamin is this your first time ? 
is this  what ? 
it is is n't it ?  it is your first time . 
that 's a laugh mrs .  robinson .  that 's really a laugh .  ha ha . 
you can admit that ca n't you ? 
are you kidding ? 
it 's nothing to be ashamed of 
wait a minute ! 
on your first time 
who said it was my first time ? 
that you 're afraid 
wait a minute . 
 of bring  inadequate  i mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way 
inadequate ! 
if you want . 
good .  i mean are we dead or something ? 
well i just do n't think we have much to say to each other . 
all we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together . 
are you tired of it ? 
i 'm not .  no .  but do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then ? 
well what do you want to talk about ? 
anything .  anything at all . 
do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences ? 
oh my god . 
well ? 
mrs .  robinson .  if that 's the best we can do let 's just get the goddamn clothes off and 
how about art . 
art .  that 's a good subject .  you start it off . 
you start it off .  i do n't know anything about it . 
oh . 
do n't you ? 
yes i do .  i know quite a bit about it . 
go ahead then . 
art .  well what do you want to know about it . 
neither . 
you 're not interested in art ? 
no . 
then why do you want to talk about it ? 
i do n't . 
no .  think of another topic .  tell me what you did today . 
do you really want me to ? 
yes i do . 
i got up . 
what do you want here ? 
nothing  only to be here . 
why do you hide in my room ? 
but surely you must know  because i love you . 
because you love me  you love me ? 
i was so alone  always alone  and suddenly you were there and said that .   no .  i am not afraid .  it is strange . 
do n't cry  it tears my heart to see you sob like that . 
nerves  just nerves .  you must forgive me .  i have had a bad evening .  i am very tired .  do you know what it is to be tired  tired of a routine existence ? 
i 'm afraid not  i usually do just what i feel like doing at the moment . 
i 'd like to smoke a cigarette . 
certainly . 
i did not know you were so beautiful .  .  .  and 
and then  ? 
no irony .  you 're so appealing  so soft  so tired .  i feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you  ever . 
and  and 
how tired you are ! 
yes  tired .  .  . 
so alone . 
alone .  all alone .   oh you strange  strange creature . 
you must n't talk russian to me . 
strange man .  .  . 
am i quite strange to you ? 
not quite strange now .  it is as if i had been expecting you .  you know once when the grand duke was alive i found a man hiding in my room  a young officer 
and .  .  .  ? 
he disappeared .  later he was found dead . 
i never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she 's alone .  
go away .  who are you  ? 
a man who could love  that is all who has forgotten everything else for you . 
you could love me .  it is so long since i have heard that word .  nobody has loved me for a long time .  it is so icycold to be famous .  one is so cruelly alone .  how is it that you  let me look at you .  your hands .  your eyes .  why could you love me ? 
i saw you just now  then i saw you cry  and now i see you in the mirror  grusinskaya .  .  . 
grusinskaya .  .  .  oh  oh if you knew how i slaved and slaved for grusinskaya  for the success of grusinskaya  for the triumph of grusinskaya .  .  .  and what is she now ?  just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases  are you listening to me  do you understand ?   i want you to understand . 
yes  i do understand . 
i think you must go now  the key is on the floor . 
i 'm not going  you know i 'm not going  let me stay here ? 
i want to be alone . 
that is not so  you do n't want to be alone .  
i want to be alone 
no  you do n't want to be alone at all  you were in despair before  if i left you you 'd feel worse than you did before you must not be alone  you must n't cry  you must forget .  .  .  tell me that i can stay with you  tell me . 
just for a minute then . 
i ?   oh no .  i do only what i take pleasure in doing . 
i should like to smoke . 
because i can see something in the mirror that you cannot .  my dear  
what can you see ? 
you are beautiful ! 
no . 
beautiful but so sad .  i did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom . 
what ? 
the veronal  you .  i 'm going to stay here with you . 
i want to be alone . 
that is not the truth .   you do not want to be alone  you 're afraid of being alone  i know you 're afraid .  i know you .  you were desperate just now if i go away you 'll be more desperate than ever .  say i am to stay with you .  .  .  say it .  
i am felix benvenuto von gaigern .  my mother called me flix . 
flix .   and how do you live ?  what kind of a person are you ? 
i 'm a prodigal son the black sheep of a white flock  i shall die on the gallows . 
really ? 
really i have n't a bit of character .  none at all . 
no ? 
when i was a little boy i was taught to ride and be a gentleman  at school it was a monastery i learned to pray and lie  and 
and ? 
and then in the war to kill and hide .  that 's all . 
and what do you do  now ? 
i 'm a gambler  i 'm running at large like a happy pig devouring anything of life that pleases me i really belong in jail
oh !  what a picture  and what else ? 
i 'm also a criminal and a hotel thief .  
that 's a silly joke . 
please look at me .  you must believe me  you must believe that i love you  that i have never known what love is  until last night .  
what is the matter ? 
oh  
here hold up ! 
call me  do you know  would you  would you like to call me by my first name ? 
oh no . 
why not ? 
i could n't do that you 're a stranger to me . 
you 're a funny little creature flaemmchen .  i ca n't make you out . 
it 's not funny at all .  one ca n't get intimate just off hand .  i could go to england with you and everything like that  supposing i met you next year and i said how do you do mr .  preysing !  and you said  that was the young lady who was my secretary in manchester' . 
exactly . 
if the preysing people get the manchester contract we shall certainly merge with the preysing company  but if they have n't they 're ruined  preysing will have to declare himself . 
shhh  here he is now . 
very simple  i 've always liked the way you dressed preysing  english is n't it ? 
yes mr .  preysing  that 's what we want to know . 
they turn out marvelous material in manchester . 
manchester  yes .  yes yes they do .  yes  now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning ?   have we cigars  water and everything ? 
we have a good many connections in england naturally . 
i mean with the manchester people ? 
we are here to discuss our merger .  naturally i can make no statement at this time .  we must begin at the beginning . 
all right . 
since on the eleventh of june this year  when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into  both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages . 
i 'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern .  active capital plant and machinery raw material and finished product  for instance  mop rags 
mop rags  ! 
oh  preysing preysing 
no water  what a place ! 
all you have to do is phone for it . 
oh  now let 's talk like adults .  you want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do .  we know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it would n't sound so good .  when you first approached us .  .  . 
we did not approach you . 
my son will be all right .  if he is n't i 'll have you killed . 
delmar ?  i never go out to california .  that 's a thousand miles from here . 
nine hundred .  bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time .  come on lilly you do n't argue with bobo . 
i know . 
take two three days .  call when you get there . 
maybe i 'll swing around los ang gleez on the way . 
why ?  what 's wrong ? 
you are a valued customer as you know . 
but what 's wrong ? 
i ca n't understand a thing like this .  it 's something you almost never see . 
what is ? 
this is some of the finest filigreed platinum i 've ever seen .  but the stones no .  they 're not diamonds mrs .  langtry . 
but they must be !  they cut glass ! 
glass will cut glass mrs .  langtry .  do you know where it was purchased ? 
why of course it is .  i can offer you  well five hundred dollars . 
i 'll get you a check . 
it 's not your fault . 
you 'll give us an opportunity to serve you again i hope .  if there 's anything you think we might be interested in .  .  . 
i have only one thing now .  are you interested ? 
well i 'd have to see it of course . 
you are seeing it .  you 're looking right at it . 
hello . 
roy dillon . 
i know that .  knew it when i saw you out there .  the best salesman here which is n't saying much .  want to talk to you dillon . 
that was a pretty backhanded compliment .  if i let people get away with things like that i would n't be a good salesman . 
you 're right .  i apologize .  but i still want to talk to you . 
lead on . 
so i heard . 
makes no difference to me if they 're only on commission .  if they do n't make good money they 're not giving us good representation and we ca n't afford to have them around .  ever supervise salesmen ? 
just myself . 
that 's right you 've had to supervise yourself .  this place needs a sales manager .  somebody who 's proved he 's a salesman and can handle other salesmen .  he 'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out new men to hire .  what do you think ? 
unable to escape she turns and attacks the killer but does n't connect . 
no blood on the knife . 
broken blood vessels on her right forearm . 
explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains .  .  . 
girl scouts . 
it 's blake .   meet me at grand view . 
where ? 
the cemetery .  .  . 
yeah alright .  .  .  i 'll be there in ten . 
only the real stiffs . 
i can be real stiff . 
charming . 
care to join me ? 
come on carter .   you know it 's michael . 
what do you want me to do put out an a . p . b .  on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone ? 
yes . 
sweet dreams blake . 
it 's blake .   how do you feel about wisconsin ? 
the door was open so we let ourselves in . 
toni blake from langley p . d . 
black magic  .  .  .   in ancient times thorn was believed to cause sickness famine and death .  translated literally it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices  .  .  .  on the celtic celebration of samhain . '
halloween . 
'when applied directly to another person thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction  to literally visit them with the devil . '
to find the rest of your family before michael myers does  or whoever 's been controlling him . 
mrs .  blankenship have you seen the little boy who came in with me and 
he 's gone . 
kara no ! 
wait a minute  .  .  . 
it 's not working ! 
that 's the whole idea of living in the country .   i thrive on the seclusion . 
i hope you did n't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote freud . 
as always your keen powers of perception astound me .   and you 're right .   i 've come to celebrate .   after thirtytwo years as psychiatric administrator guess who has been named smith 's groves new chief of staff . 
but surely rogers is n't 
retiring . 
you should know that it 's not wise to play halloween pranks on me . 
you 're the only man for the job sam .  things have n't been the same since you left .   i 'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country .   old colleagues .   this is your change to finally make a difference . 
almost a christmas scene . 
goodbye goodbye goodbye . 
just one favor . 
money ?   there 's plenty of that .  mildred got the brewery .   you 'll probably get the baseball team . 
i want you to tell me that you loved me once . 
i see . 
how unhappy he 's going to bealone in his room . 
he 'll play with his rifle i expect .  that will cheer him up . 
rifle ? 
i bought him a twentytwo yesterdayon the way home from hamburger heaven .   and where is the good doctor ?   have you two feathered a love nest somewhere ? 
he 's in east st .  louis with his mothervisiting an aunt . 
last i heard his mother was going alone . 
he 's afraid of you harold .   he knew you 'd want to fight him .   he does n't know anything about fighting .   he hates pain . 
and you a supposedly healthy woman do not detest him for his cowardice ? 
it seems highly intelligent to me . 
what kind of a country has this become ?   the men wear beads and refuse to fightand the woman adore them .   america 's days of greatness are over .   it has drunk the blue soup . 
blue soup ? 
an indian narcotic we were forced to drink .   it put us in a hazea honeycolored haze which was lavender around the edge .   we laughed we sang we snoozed .   when a bird called we answered back .  every living thing was our brother or our sister we thought .  looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long and we cried .   we had a funeral that went on for five daysfor the cockroach !   i sang oh promise me .  can you imagine ?  where the hell did i ever learn the words to oh promise me ?   looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a b36 .   all the time we were drinking more blue soup more blue soup !   never stopped drinking blue soup .   blue soup all the time .  we 'd go out after food in that honeycolored haze and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender . 
sounds quite beautiful . 
beautiful you say ?   it was n't life it was n't deathit was n't anything !   beautiful ?   seven years gone  like that like that !   seven years of silliness and random dreams !  seven years of nothingness when there could have been so much ! 
like what ? 
action !   interaction !   give and take !   challenge and response ! 
with an iron penis three feet long .  load it boy . 
you 're begging him to kill you ? 
if he thinks he 's man enough . 
that 's really what you want .   you become furious when people wo n't make you dead . 
i 'm teaching my son to be a man . 
so he can kill you .   you hate your own life that much .   you beg for a hero to kill you . 
i plan to live one hundred years ! 
no you do n't . 
if that 's the casewhat 's to prevent my killing myself ? 
honor i suppose . 
what a handsome word . 
but it 's all balled up in your head with death .   the highest honor is death .   when you talk of these animals one by one you do n't just talk of killing them .   you honored them with death .   haroldit is not honor to be killed . 
if you 've lived a good life fought well
it 's still just death the absence of lifeno honor at all .   it 's worse than the blue soup by far that nothingness .   to you though it 's the honor that crowns them all . 
may i continue with the rearing of my son ?   load that gun ! 
i feel mocked insulted with no sort of satisfaction in prospect .  we do n't have to fight with steel .  i can fight with words .   i 'm not an inarticulate ape you know who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary .   call him up in east st .  louis penelope .   tell him to come here . 
no . 
no . 
i do n't know .   i hope he never hunts .   i hope he never kills another human being . 
you hope this too ? 
do n't ! 
stop ! 
there has to be a threat of some sort nobility of some sort glamour of some sort sport of some sort .   these elements are lacking . 
ah !   the lady is armed . 
i want you to get out of here norbert .   haroldi want you to sit down in the chair and not lift a finger until norbert is gone . 
whoever has the gun you see gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do .   it 's the american way . 
i mean it ! 
then you 'd better fix your bayonet because there are n't any bullets in the gun . 
where 's the bullet ? 
ohlook at the poor crucified violin would you ? 
you fake !   you 're no better than the dumbest general in the pentagon .   you 're not going to beat harold .  you 're not going to beat anybody .  you 're not going to stay here eitheryammering and taunting until you 're most gloriously killed .  go home ! 
goodbye . 
i 'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner . 
is that a fact ? 
that maid just quit .   the place is a mess .   you can start in the master bedroom . 
not true . 
or get eaten alive . 
that 's not true eitheror need n't be unless we make it true . 
phooey . 
which we do .   but we can stop doing that . 
penelope !   we 're late ! 
i 'm sick of this argument .   i just have one more thing to say if you elect a president you support him no matter what he does .   that 's the only way you can have a country ! 
it 's the planet that 's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon . 
none of my relatives are chinese communists .   speak for yourself . 
chinese maniacs and russian maniacs and american maniacs and french maniacs and british maniacs have turned this lovely moist nourishing bluegreen ball into a doomsday device .   let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile and that 's the end of mankind . 
you can believe that if you want .  i talk to guys like you and i want to commit suicide .   you get that weightlifting set i sent you ? 
maybe god has let everybody who ever lived be rebornso he or she can see how it ends .   even pithecanthropus erectus and australopithecus and sinanthropus pekensis and the neanderthalers are back on earthto see how it ends .  they 're all on times squaremaking change for peepshows .   or recruiting marines . 
you ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day ? 
he died of a massive rupture . 
you think you 're so funny .   you 're not even funny .   right ?   right ?   you do n't hurt yourself if you start out slow . 
you 're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of dubuque ?   take care of your body yes !   but do n't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes .   do n't become obsessed by your musculature .   any one of these poor dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be .  their magic was in their muscles .  your magic is in your brains ! 
it 's good .   let him go . 
if he 'd just come out for the little league the way i asked him he 'd find out we touch all the timeshove each other slug each other and just horse around .   i 'm going to go get him
do n't !   let him have all the privacy he wants .   let him grieve let him rage .   there has never been a funeral for his father . 
what a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage . 
i feel like i 've been double crossed .   if you 'd just told me it was harold 's birthday
oh .   why is it that you want to get into film financing ? 
well bill  mind if i call you bill ?   let me be frank .  i 've made a lot of money .  i 've got my own business in detroit .  rivets .  i make rivets and sell them to fisher body .   well rivets you know can get pretty boring after a while .  when my business manager told me i should shelter some money i thought i 'd try this . 
what exactly do you have in mind ? 
i thought i 'd invest in a film .  i want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film meet the people who make films learn how it 's done .  .  . 
in other words you want to get laid ? 
not exactly .  .  . 
it 's cool .  why do you think i got in the movies ?  how much poon do you think you get in the car wash business ?   look fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy .  you can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars .  so why fuck with the movie business ? 
it 's an investment . 
if you want to watch when we shoot a film for fifty bucks i let guys stand around and watch .  it 's a lot cheaper . 
i thought you were a businessman . 
do n't get me wrong .  a couple years ago i woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing .  but the lord 's been good to me .  i can now finance any films i choose .  big ones small ones .  right now we 're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film .  live sound .  i like to keep my own money in my films .  that way you do n't have to share the profits .  there 's plenty of guys in town that 'll take it though .  but if i was you mr .  .  .  what was your name again ? 
jake . 
 .  .  . i 'd just start my own business .  that 's what i did .  get into kid porn .  that 's big now .  why do n't you come around the set ?  meet some people .  if you still want to invest i 'll ask around . 
sounds all right . 
okay .  keep in touch with my secretary . 
calm down mister .  you do n't want to get the cops in here do you ?  you got a family ? 
i do n't suppose you 've ever seen this girl before either ?  her name 's kristen but i suppose you 've never seen her ? 
why do n't you just go outdoors mister ?  cool off . 
cool off huh ?  how 's this for cooling off ? 
what do you think of that ?  or this ? 
he asked me .  you going with anybody ? 
i do n't know . 
you ever play chicken ? 
what 's that ? 
you never heard of that ? 
com 'on tell me . 
well a boy goes like this see . 
well each time he comes in closer like this . 
oh . 
i 'm worried about jake . 
i 'm off that case .  he fired me . 
he did n't look good at all .  something strange is going on .  he 's got himself into some trouble .  he would n't say what . 
i 'll tell you that was an interesting case .  the van dorn girl .  i 've handled runaway cases like it before .  usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid she pops up in about a week .  everybody denies ever seeing her but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home .  well i put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice .  in fact certain people for this girl and  nothing .   i guess i gave your brotherinlaw sort of a raw deal . 
i 've been on another case .  all day .   i suppose i can move it over .  seven fifty a week plus travel expenses . 
do you really think kristen is just a runaway ? 
i also want you to protect my brother inlaw . 
huh ? 
you have to understand .  he can be mean selfrighteous .  he had a vishund once .  loved that dog .  he came home one day and the dog bit him .  he took that dog and staked him out in the back yard .  it was winter .  every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze .  he 's capable of doing anything . 
to his own daughter ? 
to anybody . 
my name ai n't niki .  it 's pattica like in attica . 
granville 's looking for you anyway . 
who 's that ? 
the guy who bought you that ring . 
well he can just fuck himself . 
harold ! 
perhaps it is . 
ca n't complain . 
no thank you .  they stain my fingers . 
well actually it was the name of my drama teacher  louis sunshine .  perhaps you 've heard of him .  he was such an influence on the development of my instrument .  that means my body  in theatre talk .  well when i came to hollywood i felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form so i took on sunshine .  dore is my real name .  .  .  well dore actually .  my what a lovely place you have here . 
no .  i 'm learning the banjo .  do you ? 
oh i studied the guitar .  i had to give it up .  gave me calluses on my fingers .  as an actress i ca n't afford to have a tarnished instrument . 
no .  my uncle . 
oh he 's in the army .  i do so like the military do n't you ?  those uniforms make men look so virile .  i did what price glory ?  in summer stock .  i played charmaine  with a french accent . 
ohhh .  what 's harikari ? 
an ancient japanese ceremony . 
like a tea ceremony ? 
no .  like this . 
an accurate number would be difficult to gauge . 
and why is that ? 
well some worked out better than others  some had to be abandoned in the planning stages  do you include the first time ?   then there 's the question of maiming .  .  . 
just give me a rough estimate . 
well a rough estimate .  .  .  i 'd say fifteen . 
fifteen . 
a rough estimate . 
and were they all done for your mother 's benefit ? 
i would n't say benefit . 
no i suppose not .  how do you feel about your mother ? 
does that worry you ? 
yes .  it does . 
why ? 
i put a lot of effort into these things . 
ah yes . 
and a lot of time . 
i 'm sure .  but what else do you do with your time ?  do you go to school ? 
no . 
what about the draft ? 
my mother spoke to my uncle victor .  he 's in the army and he fixed it up . 
oh .  well how do you spend your day ? 
you mean when i 'm not working on a .  .  . 
yes .  what kind of things do you do ? 
icthyo sapiens april 14 1865 . 
the day abraham lincoln died .  hence abe sapien . 
abe possesses a unique frontal lobe .   unique .  that 's a word you 'll hear quite a bit around here . 
where am i  exactly sir ? 
as you entered the lobby there was an inscription 
on the desk yes .  in latin . 
impressive .  do you remember what it said ? 
in absentia luci tenebrae vinciunt .  .  . 
in the absence of light darkness prevails .  for there are things that go bump in the night agent myers .   we are the ones who bump back . 
1945 you mean .  hitler died in '45 .

you 're doing fine . 
oh please .  i 'm not pure of heart . 
agent myers is your new liaison . 
got tired of me ? 
nah .  i 'll be around red just back in the field . 
manning says i 'm too soft on you   the candy .  give him the candy . 
i wanted to see her .   it 's nobody 's business . 
it is .  you got yourself on tv again . 
myers huh ?  you have a first name ?  ? 
try not to stare .  he hates when people stare . 
we 're on the move . 
c 'mon champ !  happy halloween !  !  !  you 're taking me for a walk ! 
hold on  hold on  i thought we checked this place .  fakes and reproductions . 
what do you want me to do . 
the blood brought me this far .  i need more of the same .  or i 'll slip back .  .  . 
hurting . 
my nerves .  .  .  are beginning to work again . 
good . 
one more .  maybe two 
who ? 
the cenobites .  it 's only a matter of time before they find i 've slipped them .  i have to get away from here . 
keep your voice down . 
you 're hurting . 
you wo n't cheat me will you ?  you 'll stay with me .  help me .  then we can be together the way we were before .  we belong to each other now for better or worse .  .  . 
better .  very much better .  i 'd like something to wear .  and some cigarettes .  will you bring me some ? 
later . 
what ? 
i want an explanation first .  i want to know what happened to you . 
not know . 
tell me damn you . 
you promised me an explanation . 
a box ? 
it 's not any box .  it 's called the lament configuration .  it 's a puzzle . 
let me see . 
do n't touch it .  it 's dangerous .  it opens doors . 
what kind of doors ? 
to experience beyond anything ever known .  at least that 's what i was promised when i bought it .  pleasure from heaven or hell .  i did n't much care which . 
hell .  .  . 
i was bored .  i 'd done everything .  i 'd gone to the limits .  there was nothing left to experience .  at least nothing i could buy on earth . 
and you came back here to solve the puzzle 
sure .  somewhere safe .   safe .  christ !  they tortured me here .  in this room . 
who did ? 
the cenobites .  the creatures the box set free .   sometimes i think they 're still here .  just behind the walls .  them and their hooks and their beasts .  just waiting to break out again .  except that i 've got the box . 
you 're still afraid . 
you would be .  they tore me apart . 
so you were cheated . 
no .  they gave me experiences beyond the limits .  pain and pleasure indivisible . 
and the blood let you out ? 
it gave me a little chance and i took it .  they wo n't get me back .  i 'm going to live and you 're going to help me .  yes ? 
yes .  they 'll never find us . 
i do n't . 
so where 's the harm ? 
i said no . 
then find me somebody else before they come looking . 
sure .  why not ? 
'bye . 
i do n't know . 
really . 
long time ago .   i was just thinking about her .   i was her first boyfriend . 
i hate to quibble with you rob but she married her first boyfriend .  kevin bannister . 
you gotta be kidding me . 
that 's right .   kevin .   she 's mrs .  kevin bannister .   she lives in australia . 
i beg your pardon ? 
technically i 'm number one .   i went out with her a week before kevin did .   her first boyfriend .   me . 
it wo n't go any louder . 
i do n't want to hear public enemy right now . 
public enemy !   all i 'm trying to do is cheer us up .   go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if i care . 
i do n't want old sad bastard music either .   i just want something i can ignore . 
but it 's my new tape .   my monday morning tape .   i made it last night just for today . 
yeah well it 's fucking monday afternoon .   you should get out of bed earlier . 
do n't you want to hear what 's next ? 
what 's next ? 
play it . 
say it . 
little latin lupe lu . 
since when did this shop become a fascist regime ? 
since you brought that bullshit tape in . 
great .   that 's the fun of working in a record store .   playing crappy pap you do n't want to listen to .   i thought this tape was going to be you know a conversation stimulator .  i was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a monday morning and all that and you just had to ruin it . 
we 'll do it next monday . 
well what 's the point in that ? 
rob .   top five musical crimes perpetrated by stevie wonder in the '80 's and '90 's .   subquestion  is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter day sins ?   is it better to burn out than to fade away ? 
you just drove a fucking customer away barry . 
we did n't even really have it .   i happen to know for a fact that the only stevie wonder single we have is do n't drive drunk .  i was just goofing on the straight and it never cost you a penny . 
not the point . 
oh so what 's the point then ? 
i do n't want you talking to our customers like that again . 
our customers ?  you think that mr .  l . l .  bean out there is going to be a regular ? 
hi .   i 've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and i 'm thinking i did n't take them with me .   have you seen them around ? 
i 'll look for em .   how you doing ? 
i 'm sorry to call but i need that stuff .  .  . 
fine i 'm sure it 's in the file at home .   i 'll call you when i find it and then we 'll talk . 
we 'll talk some other time . 
great .  .  .  that 's great . 
have you slept with him yet ? 
i told you i slept with him . 
no not  i mean have you you know 
is that why you wanted to see me ? 
i guess . 
oh rob .   what do you want me to say ? 
i want you to say that you have n't and i want it to be the truth . 
you must have known it would happen .  you could n't have been entirely unprepared .   like you said i 've been living with the guy .   we were bound to get around to it sometime . 
nothing . 
we can meet for another drink if you want .   so i can explain it better .  i owe you that much . 
look i gotta go .   i work too you know . 
will you call me ? 
i do n't have your number . 
call me at work .   we can arrange to meet properly .   i do n't want this to be the last conversation we have .   i know what you 're like . 
you do huh . 
it 's me . 
i figured it was .   where are you ? 
i think the big question here is where are you if you do n't mind my saying so and i think i know where you are .   you 're running .   on the run .   you 're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship and you 're just going to hit it again with ian but it 's going to be with a world music bunny rabbitlooking earthshoewearing doctor whowatching twit who does n't really understand you not the way that i do and will more in the future and you 'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you 're in now only later .  and with .  .  .  him . 
i 'm not  hold on .  .  . 
jesus .   i do not know .   i 'll talk to you later . 
think about what i said .   i mean if you want to experiment or whatever 
i 'm not experimenting .   why do n't you go experiment . 
i do n't want to .   do n't need to .   i love you . 
you do n't ever think about other people ? 
no .  .  .  not really .  .  .  i mean i think about it .  .  .  but no i do n't really think about it . 
is that the last of it ? 
yep .   i might have missed some stuff .  i 'm so used to some things being here that i do n't even notice them . 
those look heavy .   where 's ian ? 
he 's at home .   listen i ca n't believe he went to the store .   i 'm mortified actually .   i 'm really sorry .   he had no right to do that and i told him so . 
it was kind of funny . 
you still together ?   going all right ? 
i do n't really want to talk about it to be honest . 
that bad eh ? 
you know what i mean . 
i 'll bet you ca n't remember what you were doing here can you ?   i mean how much are you making now ?   sixty ?  seventy ?   and you were living in this shitty place . 
you know i did n't mind .   and it 's not as if ray 's place is any better . 
i 'm sorry but can we get this straight ?   what is his fucking name ian or ray ?   what do you call him ? 
ray .   i hate ian . 
i hate him too .   so i just call him mavis .  or sissyboy .  or mavis the sissyboy . 
you make me laugh much more than ray does if that 's what you 're getting at .   but i already knew you could make me laugh .   it 's everything else i do n't know about . 
you know i 'm a good person . 
mmm hmm . 
you know that i can cook my ass off when i feel like it . 
oh ho so very infrequently . 
are you ? 
no one knows you 're here ? 
no .   i had to talk to you . 
you had to do nothing ! 
you 're wrong . 
you 're a fool . 
maybe . 
you 've been listening to rumors . 
our cars were seen together in felton .   they 're calling me an accessory to murder . 
you are .   now . 
richard taupin has become cumbersome .   it would be best if he just disappeared . 
not all of them . 
when you finish what then ? 
i go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad mr .  taupin . 
you make it all sound so simple . 
the only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property i 've aquired .   that requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in gettysburg .   but that 's where you come in . 
you want me to front for you . 
the less exposure i recieve around government buildings the better .   you as mrs .  taupin will attract considerably less attention than i . 
yes . 
i wish i could . 
it will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to gettysburg . 
yes . 
well as long as we 're stuck here . 
they do it each year . 
i thought it might be a nice break from all of this . 
there 's a catch .   you 're supposed to wear 19th century clothing . 
not tonight .   tonight i have a drink with an old friend . 
it 's good to see you kahn . 
neuvich the clown of the crusades . 
but then rides up pope pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross climbs off his papal horse draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on .   and what did neuvich dear dear drunken neuvich do ? 
offered the pope one of his whores . 
good times then .   a man could stretch his legs without bring ing half the world down around his ears .   not like now . 
he always did . 
since you last saw me . 
you were never a kid . 
you 're insane . 
no seriously .   we used to shoot pool together in rangoon . 
how do you do it kahn ?   how do you live so full of life for so long ? 
tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have .   all else is just marking time .   you 're marking time . 
i 've had a few more concerns . 
you 're wrong . 
you do n't run as hard macleod .  you just do n't run as hard anymore . 
not so long . 
my quarry grows clever with age .   and the others incompetent . 
give me the district attorney 's office .   i 'll tell you what you 'll be doing  making brooms in the state penitentiary .   hello d 'arrasty !  this is hartwell .  come over to my office will you ?  i 've just arrested a couple of important birds and i want to take their confessions . 
get out of here you ! 
your luck 's not with you now ! 
all the lawyers in the world are n't going to help you ! 
this is the morning post you 're talking to ! 
the power of the press huh ! 
out of the mouths of babes . 
he 's insane or drunk or something .  why if this unfortunate man williams has really been reprieved i personally am tickled to death .  are n't you pete ? 
what did you say your name was  pinkus ? 
why i 'm surprised mr .  burns .  that 's no way to talk to your wife  even if she 's no longer your wife . 
hello hildy ! 
hello walter .   hi louie  how 's the slotmachine king ? 
you know what .  how long since we 've seen each other ? 
let 's see .  i was in reno six weeks  then bermuda .  .  .  oh about four months i guess .  seems like yesterday to me . 
maybe it was yesterday .  been seeing me in your dreams ? 
no  mama does n't dream about you any more walter .  you would n't know the old girl now . 
oh yes i would .  i 'd know you any time 
i notice you still remember it . 
i 'll always remember it .  if i had n't remembered it i would n't have divorced you . 
you know hildy i sort of wish you had n't done it . 
done what ? 
divorced me .  it sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself .  it almost gives him a feeling he was n't wanted . 
holy mackerel !  look walter that 's what divorces are for . 
nonsense .  you 've got the oldfashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever  till death us do part' .  why a divorce does n't mean anything today .  it 's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge .  we 've got something between us nothing can change . 
i suppose that 's true in a way .  i am fond of you walter .  i often wish you were n't such a stinker . 
now that 's a nice thing to say . 
well why did you promise me you would n't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works ? 
well i meant to let you go  but you know you never miss the water till the well runs dry . 
a fellow your age hiring an airplane to write  hildy do n't be hasty  remember my dimple .  walter .  !  it held things up twenty minutes while the judge ran out to watch it . 
well i do n't want to brag but i 've still got the dimple  and in the same place  i just acted like any husband who does n't want to see his home broken up . 
what home ? 
all i know is that instead of two weeks in atlantic city with my bridegroom i spent two weeks in a coal mine with john kruptzky  age sixtythree  getting food and air out of a tube !  you do n't deny that .  do you ? 
deny it !  i 'm proud of it !  we beat the whole country on that story . 
well suppose we did ?  that is n't what i got married for .  what 's the good of  look walter i came up here to tell you that you 'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day  sending twenty telegrams  all the rest of it because i 'm 
let 's not fight hildy .  tell you what .  you come back to work on the paper and if we find we ca n't get along in a friendly way we 'll get married again . 
what ?  !  ! 
i have n't any hard feelings . 
walter you 're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way .  now would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what i came up here for ? 
sure come on .  we 'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything . 
i have a lunch date .  i just want 
you can break it ca n't you ? 
no i ca n't . 
sure you can .  come on . 
do n't tell me what to do !  we 're divorced  i 'm a free woman .  you 're not my husband and you 're not my boss !  and what 's more you 're not going to be my boss . 
what do you mean by that ? 
just what i said .  that 's what i 
you mean you 're not coming back to work here ? 
that 's the first time you 've been right today .  that 's what i 
you 've had a better offer eh ? 
you bet i 've got a better offer . 
well go on and take it .  work for somebody else !  that 's the gratitude i get for 
i know walter but i 
what were you when you came here five years ago ?  a little college girl from a school of journalism !  i took a little dollfaced mugg 
you would n't have taken me if i had n't been dollfaced ! 
why should i ?  i thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering . 
listen walter 
i made a great reporter out of you hildy but you wo n't be half as good on any other paper and you know it .  you need me and i need you  and the paper needs both of us . 
well the paper 'll have to learn to do without me .  and so will you .  it just did n't work out walter . 
it would have worked if you 'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter .  but no !  you had to marry me and spoil everything . 
i was n't satisfied !  i suppose i proposed to you ! 
well you practically did !  making googoo eyes at me for two years till i broke down .  and i still claim i was tight the night i proposed .  if you 'd been a gentleman you 'd have forgotten all about it .  but not you ! 
you  you 
this egelhoffer 's pretty good . 
yeah ?  what did he ever do for his country ? 
do n't you remember ?  he 's the guy went to washington to interview the brain trust and gave out a statement that they were all sane .  it created a sensation ! 
what have you got hildy ? 
who 's this guy she 's gonna marry ? 
well if she 's gonna write fiction there 's nothing like being a reporter . 
what 's the use ?  i ca n't win a pot . 
lioness rushes to defense of cub .

wakin' me up in the middle of the night  talkin' to me about things they do n't understand .  callin' me a bolshevik .  i 'm an anarchist .  it 's got nothin' to do with bombs .  it 's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom .  you see that do n't you ? 
sure i do earl . 
do n't cry mollie there 's nothing to cry about . 
how 'd you get here earl ? 
down the drainpipe .  i did n't mean to shoot him .  you believe me do n't you mollie ?

you 're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch .

that 's the good news ? 
 .  .  . and we 'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture ?  that 's my man . 
huh ?  oh good good . 
strange thing is if my calculations are right it 'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway .  the signal reduces itself every time it recycles .  eventually it will disappear .  are you listening ? 
can you believe this ? 
what 're you talking about ? 
have n't you been watching ? 
what happened ? 
just do it ! 
remember i told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction . 
not really .  .  . 
that signal .  it 's a countdown . 
a countdown to what ? 
think .  it 's like in chess .  first you strategically position your pieces .  then when the timing 's right .  you strike . 
egyptian mail .  morning edition .   run !

does that bother you bill ?   i always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute she has to have bad eyesight . 
he 'll never sign a statement boss let alone get on a witness stand . 
when something 's rotten in the land bill it generally is n't just one fish we 'll get corroboration .  .  .  find this clay bertrand .   if i were a betting man i 'd give you 10 to 1 it 's an alias .   start checking around the quarter . 
and the six of us with almost no budget and in secret are going to solve the case that the warren commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars could n't solve .   we ca n't keep up with the crimes in the parish as it is chief . 
the murder of a president bill is a crime in orleans parish too .   i did n't pick you because of your legal skill you know . 
gee thanks boss . 
we 're saying that when oswald went to russia he was not a real defector that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died that 's what we 're saying . 
and therefore because oswald pulled the trigger the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief .   that 's what you 're saying ! 
i 'll go you one better !   maybe oswald did n't even pull the trigger bill .  the nitrate test indicates he did n't even fire a rifle on november 22nd .  and on top of that they did n't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day . 
he had his palm print on the weapon . 
it went to the goddamn fbi and they did n't find a goddamn thing .   it comes back a week later and one guy in the dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all i know he could 've taken off oswald at the morgue .   there 's no chain of evidence bill .   and what about the tow guns actually seen in the depository ?   one an enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a mauser described by deputy weitzman .  .  .  maybe just maybe lee oswald was exactly what he said he was bill  a patsy .   take it at face value .   lou susie i 'm going with my gut here .   he 's got an alias of hidell to buy the rifle o . h .  lee to rent the room right ?   what 's in a name right ?   in intelligence they 're assumed to be fake .   a name is sort of like a postbox number a code  several different people can use the same name right ?   then why ca n't somebody be using oswald 's name ? 
to frame him obviously .   you got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think bill !   they 're not ordinary crooks . 
let 's start making some assumptions about the man .   why would he leave a path as big as lee harvey oswald 's ?  this is not a thin trail gentlemen it is a very wide one .   who found the evidence ?   who set him up ?   lou bill susie i want you to go back and check all the sightings of oswald in dallas new orleans and mexico in the summer and fall of '63  see if it 's the same guy . 
what are you driving at boss ? 
we 're going back into the case lou  the murder of the president .   i want you to take some money from the fees and fines account and go to dallas  talk to some people .   bill i want you to get oser on the medical the autopsy susan on oswald and ruby histories tax records .  .  . 
i ca n't say that comes as a surprise anymore . 
a photographer from the dallas times herald got some great shots of them never published .  .  . 
hoboes i knew of old used to sleep in their clothes  these two look pretty young . 
 .  .  . not a single frayed collar or cuff new haircuts fresh shaves clean hands  new shoe leather .  look at the ear of the cop .  .  .  that 's a wire .   what 's a cop wearing a headset for ?   i think they 're actors chief they 're not cops . 
we need to find more witnesses lou . 
there was rose cheramie .   a whore .  two cubans threw her out of a car on the way to dallas . 
graveyard dead near big sandy texas in '65 .   two in the morning on some highway .   a hit and run . 
unless he or someone else wants him to get caught .   maybe he never ordered the weapon lou .   somebody else did .  it was picked up at the post office early morning when oswald 's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job .   lou come alive .   these things are not adding up . 
i know you do lou .   i 'm doing three more lectures this month .   you 're all doing an incredible job sue al numa .   but this is one where if you do n't nail the other guy you 're dead .   how did jack ruby dies so quick ?   of what ?   cancer right ?   a history of nazi germany lou .   they were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30 's .   we learned a lot more than you think from the nazis .   read this .  our biological warfare lab is in fort detrick maryland .   close to where the national cancer institute is located .   think about it .   think the unthinkable  question everything . 
and it ai n't pretty   .  .  . the ad has spent more than 8000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since november 1966 . 
i have a plane to catch .  .  .  going to washington .   an interesting lead says he 's closely connected to these events but he wo n't come down here .  .  .  i know what you 're going through with ferrie lou .   we 'll talk tomorrow . 
i 'm onto ferrie 's cuban paymaster eladio del valle in miami .   i gotta get him in boss .   i need more men  i ca n't even pull the teams to watch ferrie .  .  .  this is our case ! 
i 'd say the opposite  hypertension . 
sure ever been to the riverbottom ? 
i do n't think so . 
it 's okay .  it 's a cop hangout . 
could n't we just stop at a seven eleven ? 
i thought you might want a drink ? 
i 'd love one but not there . 
we could stop at the hilton by the airport . 
is it dark ? 
it 's kind of a sports bar
that does n't sound dark . 
why does it need to be dark ? 
'cause i look like i just got outta jail that 's why .  you droppin' me off at home right ?  there 's a place by me . 
great . 
ten pounds .  i lose it and put it back on . 
that 's why i do n't quit .  if i ca n't fly anymore i 'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand . 
what 's your brand ? 
davidoffs .  i get em in mexico .  they 're hard to find here .  i was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend 's head open with a baseball bat . 
was she helpful ? 
she was more helpful than the fuckin' public defender .   i do n't know  i guess what i need is a lawyer find out what my options are . 
you know i figured out the other day i 've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since i 've been in the business .  i 'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related .  if you want i can help you look at your options . 
i am as a matter of fact . 
so far i 've been told i can cooperate and get probation maybe .  or i can stand mute and get as much as five years .  does that sound right ? 
i 'd say if you 're tried and found guilty you wo n't get more than a year and a day .  that 's state time .  prison . 
shit . 
but they wo n't want to take you to trial .  they 'll offer you simple possession a few months of county time and a year or two probation .   how bout another ? 
sure . 
yeah but that 's not what this was about .  they were fuckin waitin' for my ass .  they knew i had that money they even knew the amount .  the one who searched my bag from l . a . p . d .  dargus hardly even looked at it .  oh i 'd say there 's fifty thousand here .  what would you say ?  but all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to customs and i could tell they did n't want to do that . 
they wanted you to tell them what you know . 
i had em too .  i burnt those two starky and hutch motherfuckers down .  then their asses lucked out and found that coke . 
what did they want to know ? 
who gave me the money and who i was giving it to .  and some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off .  said it was him who told them bout me . 
that 's him .  how do you know em ? 
i wrote him on monday .  they found him dead on tuesday . 
ordell pick up his bond ? 
same as you .  ten thousand . 
the federal agent kinda half hinted ordell might of done beaumont . 
you mentioned a guy from l . a . p . d .  but you did n't mention the federal . 
i did n't ? 
no you did n't .  what branch ? 
ray nicolet with alcohol tobacco and firearms . 
it was the other guy who busted me . 
'cause if he busted you you 'd play hell bonding out of federal court .  he does n't want you mad at him he wants you to tell him what you know .  he uses you to get a line on ordell make a case then take him federal .  you know what ordell 's into ? 
i have a pretty good idea .  ordell ai n't no bootlegger and i doubt he 's smugglin' cuban cigars .  so that only leaves one thing an a . t . f .  man would be interested in . 
how many trips did you make ? 
with ten thousand ?  nine . 
he 's got that kinda money ? 
it 's all in lock boxes in a mexico bank .  but he 's got a problem .  he 's  what do you call it when you got money but do n't have cash ? 
cash poor ? 
that 's it .  he 's cash poor .  he kept on me till i finally said okay .  i 'll bring whatever fits in a nineby twelve envelope .  i got paid five hundred dollars and his friend mr .  walker in mexico gave me the envelope . 
if you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law why not pack a hundred grand ? 
ask a . t . f .  they might give you permission . 
yeah if i cooperate . 
well jackie you got caught you 're gonna have to give em something . 
but if all i can give em is ordell 's name  i do n't really know shit about what he does or how he does it  that do n't give me much to bargain with . 
give em what you got .  offer to help .  show a willingness to be helpful .  you want to stay out of jail do n't you ? 
i think maybe i have more options than i thought . 
shut your raggedy ass up and sit down . 
way i see it me and you only got one thing to talk about .  what you willing to do for me ? 
baby i did n't 
it 's okay .  i forgive you .  now let 's say if i tell on you i walk .  and if i do n't i go to jail . 
one hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name if i 'm convicted up to a year or put on probation .  if i have to do more than a year you pay another hundred thousand . 
all your money 's in mexico . 
i been thinkin about that too and i got me a idea . 
talk to you tomorrow . 
the cockatoo inn ?  where 's that ? 
it 's right on hawthorne boulevard and manhattan beach boulevard .  it 's red brick .  .  . 
oh wait you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it ? 
it 's a cockatoo . 
i do okay . 
you a fine lookin' woman jackie .  i bet you do a damn sight better than okay .  you think anybody followed you ? 
i do n't think so but it do n't really matter .  they know i 'm meeting you . 
how the fuck they know that ? 
i told them . 
they already know it 's you . 
well shit .  that do n't mean you gotta confirm it ! 
look the only way i can get permission to fly is if i agree to help them .  which is what i have to appear to be doing .  so i give them something they already know .  you .

i told them you got a half a million dollars in mexico and you want me to bring it here . 
you know it 's for you .

i always think you 're cute .  i think you 're beautiful . 
well i do . 
yeah .  sure .  once tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go . 
we could get back together too . 
were we together ? 
what about katrina de voort ?  you could go out with katrina de voort . 
i do n't like katrina . 
i totally heard you did . 
i do n't .  katrina smells like soup .  her whole house smells of soup . 
um hi ? 
leah just told me you were going with her . 
yeah i did ask her if she wanted to go .  a bunch of us from the team are going to benihana then the prom then vijay 's parents' cabin .

juno macguff . 
no thank you .  i 'm off sex . 
my partner uses these every time we have intercourse .  they make his balls smell like pie . 
congrats . 
my dad used to be in the army but now he 's just your average hvac specialist .  he and my mom got divorced when i was five .  she lives on a havasu reservation in arizona .  .  . 
which maneuver sir ?  the one in which i moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another or the one in which i cleared a sixtyfour ounce blue slushie in ten minutes ? 
no no i 'm definitely not asking for anything .  except maybe mercy .  like it would be really great if nobody hit me . 
what have you done junebug ?  did you hit someone with the previa ? 
you 're pregnant ? 
i 'm so sorry you guys .  if it 's any consolation i have heartburn that 's like radiating down to my kneecaps and i have n't gone number two since wednesday .  morning ! 
the baby ?  i do n't know anything about it yet .  i only know it 's got fingernails allegedly . 
paulie bleeker ?  i did n't know he had it in him ! 
no it 's not .  paulie is virile by the way .  he was very good in .  .  .  chair . 
yeah well there 's this couple who 've been trying to have a baby for five years . 
i changed my mind early .  i 'm not gonna climb up that hollywood sign with you .  .  .  i decided .  i think your mean and you hurt people . 
walter livesy . 
think .  i might just have to kill you walter .  how do you feel about that ? 
not so good .  you sure you have to ? 
i do n't know .  wish i did . 
vernon florida . 
never heard of it any huntin' ? 
turkey mostly . 
turkey 's are real smart .  smarter than most people think .  .  . 
what do you need a bible for ? 
no sir . 
best kind . 
well it 's like this mr .  kessler . 
brian . 
well it 's like this bri' .  i do n't eat much in the mornin' never have .  maybe a beer once in a while lucky lager 's my favorite . 
oh .  .  .  i do some work up at the merrick mirror factory or i used to .  .  . 
that 's a good idea .  unfortunately most of them have been executed . 
 .  .  . too bad . 
how much do i owe you ? 
forget it . 
i guess so .  i gotta stop off home too . 
why i do what ? 
that . 
why i give pennies ? 
yeah .  why you give money . 
did you look at that guy ?  what the fuck .  he had no legs .   he had no half his lower body .  he 's gotta shit out of his ribcage . 
that 's just it .  it 's elitist .  it 's reverse elitism .  because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up .  i notice what you do . 
what are you talking about ? 
whenever you see someone who 's really messed up especially amputees and retards .  you give them money .  but if it 's just a regular bum you pass them by . 
so . 
so .  these people live on the same streets .  it 's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up .  the regular bums are n't poor enough for you you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks . 
so .  you never know when you can end up like that . 
right . 
i 'll tell you why .  because when i was little i had a fat cousin cousin luke .  and he used to make fun of the handicapped .  and one day he had a bad stomachache .  so he drank a bottle of pepto and his ass blew off . 
shut up . 
i 'm telling you the truth .  and after that i 've always givin' my money to retards .  because that 's the reverse of what he did . 
good luck ? 
yeah good luck .  i mean what the fuck .  the guy had no legs . 
yeah . 
shut the fuck up . 
i do n't know .  how much do you want ? 
fifteen for me . 
yeah probably . 
naw .  but we should run by the park and get a dime .  maybe darcy will be at the park . 
you are ? 
yeah .  the other day some sort of chinese bitch told me i 'd look good with muscles . 
yes . 
what kind of problem ? 
i think you 're lying .   that 's what kind of problem . 
what are you saying ? 
casual ?   you were boning her were n't you ? 
it was n't serious .   what 's your problem ? 
you are !   i do n't like you . 
fine do n't ask me out on a date . 
it means if i were a killer and i thought the police were closing in on me i might invent someone to try and put them off the scent . 
that 's crazy !   why would i draw attention to myself like that ? 
you like to play games do n't you peter ? 
he says on the photo he 'll call tomorrow at eleven .   why not come back then and listen for yourself . 
oh we 'll be back .   you can bet on it . 
no . 
he says it 's a game .   all games have a strategy . 
all you gotta do is look at the map . 
his victims are n't random .   it only means that they appear to be random .  there 's a connection we just have to find it . 
what ? 
not what  who .   morpheus .   the greek god of dreams .   look at the next line .  her god has gone and left his home . 
let 's see how much he wants to play . 
you think you 're going to catch him on a trace ?   everything he does is planned out well in advance .   the only way we 're going to get him is to rattle him  make him slip up . 
maybe you should . 
that 's great . 
wait i 've saved the best for last .  andy hit the lights will you ? 
yeah . 
how long she been dead ? 
i 'd say at least eighteen hours . 
that means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message . 
well what ?   i told you this was a stupid idea .   you ca n't learn anything from someone in a few minutes . 
you did n't pick up any vibes from the guy ? 
i 'm a psychologist frank .  .  .  not a psychic .   what 's this all about anyway ? 
what did dr .  fulton tell you ? 
we 're not sure . 
what do you think he did ? 
we think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation . 
it 's important . 
and this jeremy
edmonds .   i know .   you lost to karpov in '82 did n't you ? 
but we heard him . 
it could have been a tape .   a prerecorded conversation between sanderson and himself . 
well the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority  and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim . 
what about the way he arranged the body ? 
anything else ? 
yes .   why disguise your voice if no one knows it ? 
i was thinking the same thing .   he must be local .   it 's logical for him to assume that the police would be there but he recognized andy 's voice and called him by name .   what about this ? 
i would think it 's some type of clue as to where he 's going to kill next ? 
meaning ? 
never mind my ears !  go away ! 
maybe you 'd better look around for another candidate .  i do n't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush . 
i do n't have to look around .  i 've found the husband i want .  you can kiss me now . 
thank you but i can wait . 
i ca n't . 
about what ? 
i ca n't wait either . 
colwyn . 
no .  they watch me closely but they have n't harmed me . 
in a great fortress in the mountains .  wait .  something 's happening . 
colwyn  .  .  . 
where is the fortress ? 
i do n't know .  it 's a maze of tunnels .  i ca n't see out . 
i will find you .  i will be with you . 
i know it . 
i love you lyssa i love you  .  .  . 
colwyn .  colwyn .   i love you colwyn . 
you must move away from the center . 
all the passages are guarded . 
i do n't know how . 
you have the power .  uwill itu . 
all directions are the same here . 
he will not come .  you will be my queen . 
barak is still strong in the north and tendo holds the high passes .  but the great desert forts have fallen . 
freylag 's stronghold ? 
it has been taken freylag and all his people slaughtered . 
it is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen . 
the attacks are unceasing by night the dark ones by day those of our people who have sold themselves to them those traitors who are called the slayers . 
it is the way of all invaders .  those they would conquer they divide buying allies with promises of land and power . 
we will hold .  their power is not unlimited . 
modred has treated with the dark ones . 
it is important to assure the succession . 
yes . 
i knew . 
you knew !  you are a rude bumpkin ! 
that i am my lady . 
a match for your son i think . 
a fine match . 
they will have the life that you and i might have had . 
yes .  we lost five . 
you were lucky .  i lost thirty there . 
how many did you lose ? 
sixty at the needle another thirty in the forest .  only ten of us made it back . 
we will have to try again .  his knowledge is great .  without it we cannot hope to win . 
he leads a group of slayers under the leopard banner . 
such a vision will be opposed .  who seeks it ? 
the new king . 
with an old voice ? 
you know the voice . 
yes .  you have left your place in the needle .  it is the time then . 
it is the time . 
i will seek the fortress for you . 
yeah .  .  .  and still in messina .   he 's my uncle . 
huh ?  are you alfredo 's son then ? 
no .  .  .  dino 's . 
yes .  .  .  twice . 
did you fish in messina ?  the pesce spada ? 
no .  .  . 
it 's a specialty down there .   it 's a fishing boat with in front a long pole near the surface .  then near the cabin a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout . 
you 're right son .  you must care the links with your family always .   it 's the only important thing in the world .

it 's mine to risk . 
no more words .   until i touch the ocean with my hands .  .  .  it 's all just words . 
where am i ? 
in a hospital . 
which hospital ?   did you take me back ?

you ever lose somebody stephanie ? 
mr .  parker i 'm supposed to give you your fish sticks . 
did you tell him everything you wanted to ?   did you do everything you could while he was here ? 
someone should be with you . 
good morning . 
oh that 's not mine . 
you should .   children are a blessing from god .   i have four . 
you took my class in la .  you had the best high kick i 've ever seen .  are you one of my lawyers ? 
sort of . 
i 'm glad it 's you and not donovan . 
he means well .  he 's really brilliant and all . 
who could better understand than me ? 
whatever it is  it could save you . 
that 's just it  it would ruin me ! 
how ? 
i know !  you helped me go from a six to a four ! 
i 'm a fraud !  but it 's not like normal people can have this ass !  if my fans knew i 'd lose everything .  i 've already lost my husband .  i rather be in jail then lose my reputation ! 
i believe you !  do n't worry . 
enrique 's gay .  i 'm sure of it . 
he did leave a cher tape in the pool house once 
did she have a weapon in her hand ? 
no . 
was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon ? 
uh yeah because the bitch shot him . 
was there any evidence that mrs .  windham shot him ? 
his dead body with a bullet in it . 
not that i saw .  but like i said i went straight upstairs to take a shower . 
and when you came downstairs what happened ? 
i saw brooke standing over his body drenched in his blood . 
but mrs .  windham did n't have a gun ? 
no she 'd stashed it by then . 
i 'm quitting . 
law school was a mistake .  getting this internship was a mistake . 
what 're you talking about ?  you earned it 
going back to la .  maybe i can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the swedish bikini team .  no more navy blue suits .  no more panty hose .  no more trying to be something i 'm not . 
what if you 're trying to be something you are ?  the hell with donovan .  stay . 
oh my god !  !

then forget it .  besides i have an early class tomorrow . 
so friday at eight ? 
is he the only one ? 
what do you think ? 
helloo .  .  .  he just had lunch with his grandmother .  you know he got the rock . 
i 'm canceling the mixer .  we 'll blacklist sigma chi . 
thank you serena but i do n't think it 'll do any good . 
what happened ? 
i just do n't understand what went wrong 
i do n't know !  i do n't know anything any more !   i just need to be by myself . 
are you sure ? 
better we eat him than the other way round . 
no false modesty lad .   you 're a proper champion .   achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit . 
well then you 've got the sword and you 've got the armor all 's lacking is the steed . 
screwball !   you dolt !   i 've a mind to change you into a toad . 
something 's coming . 
it would appear so . 
careful lad . 
the colt 's still too small . 
i 'm small .  .  .  and i can make myself smaller still .  .  .  small as a bee !  small as dust .  .  .  !   want to see me do it ? 
we 've no time for tricks this day honeythorn gump . 
tricks is it ?   why i 'll trick ye !  ungrateful whelp !   i 'll sour your milk and bird droppings 'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk . 
save your mischief for the black baron . 
aye !   that too . 
you 'll need more than bird droppings for blackheart . 
i 'll drop a cow on the knave ! 
drop a mountain on him and we wo n't need our troops . 
we march on castle couer de noir within the hour . 
how do you plan on finding this here castle if ye do n't mind me asking ? 
a true and troubling question gump .  .  .  we 'll start from where the unicorn was killed .   the baron must have left a trail . 
track the demon to his lair . 
aye .   and hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying . 
whatever for ? 
jenny greenteeth said  follow the raven in her flight .  .  . 
aye .   said to follow it to the edge of night .   but is this the right bird ? 
i 'm sure .   it spoke to me . 
birds speak to me all the time .  what did it say ? 
beware . 
sounds like the bird we want .   all right lads follow yon raven ! 
couer de noir !   a demon if the devil ever made one . 
he chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot . 
that would be the baron's way .  there 'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished . 
how do i get the horn back ? 
you 'll need the fastest steed alive for couer de noir 's castle rests at the very edge of the earth .   only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of achilles will protect you from his fury . 
where do i find the baron's castle ? 
follow the raven in her flight follow old black wing to the edge of night .  .  . 
not very precise directions . 
come sit beside me sweet boy and i 'll draw you a map . 
nay .   tempting as your invitation be .   tell me one thing more . 
ask away sweet man . 
what became of the princess ? 
princess ?   i know of no princess . 
princess lili godwin's daughter .  she was with me when calamity struck but after i could find no trace of her . 
is she fair this princess ? 
exceeding fair . 
as fair as me ? 
twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky . 
she 's dead ! 
no ! 
dead dead dead . 
i do n't believe you . 
far as you 're concerned she 's dead believe it or not . 
do n't be sad jack not with me here to give you cheer . 
tis not the time to speak of cheer . 
you 'll visit again ? 
as a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom . 
what a fine meal you 'd make be the rest of you sweet as your tongue . 
i pray god grants it me . 
sorry . 
then i 'd kiss you without turning my garments insideout and sewing bells all over . 
no need for bells jack .   i 'll nay enchant ye . 
no fear of that now . 
then tis not for chastity ?  methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night . 
i live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousandyearold oak .   my bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins .   there 's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away . 
i 'm partial to oaks as are all faerie folk .   may n't i come visit sometime ? 
i 'd be honored . 
only that ? 
and charmed of course . 
fie !   do n't speak of charms .   i should charm you for being so dull witted . 
i had no thought of offending you oona . 
do i not please you jack ? 
in every way . 
and am i not fair ? 
wondrously so . 
then why do you speak sweeter words to jenny greenteeth ? 
that was in jest . 
jest with me then . 
how so ? 
tell me i 'm fair as you did the hag . 
you are fair as the first new flower of spring .  .  . 
and sweet ? 
sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind . 
pray you be sweet as your words dear jack . 
a faerie 's love makes anything possible . 
i 'm promised to another ! 
what shape i take matters not .   long you for another ?   i 'll give you your heart 's desire . 
you .  .  .  you .  .  .  you mortal you ! 
please .  .  . 
why should i feel such pain ?   should be the other way round .  .  .  i could vex you .  .  .  make you dance your life away .  .  . 
threats wo n't make me love you .   tis not the way of the human heart . 
and as barren of love as stone . 
i would build a wall around me with such stone so the likes of you might never enter . 
be fair oona . 
you beware jack !   you and your porridgepot heart ! 
he builds models for architects .   his dad on the other hand was the real deal .   designed and built the coolest houses i 've ever seen . 
he wants the entire roof taken off and lowered . 
i 've been dreading you . 
a violation ? 
oh yes . 
and if i enclosed it ? 
an exhaust system or a window is code . 
a sink ? 
allowed outside the enclosed area . 
i flushed it down the toilet . 
if that 's what it takes . 
it 's thirty feet . 
well if it is we have a problem . 
after your last extension request and with design review and the board of adjustment and the appeals to the city council was there an amended permit ? 
to the patio and one northfacing window .  .  .   and six inches to the height . 
months . 
what are you on ? 
pardon me ? 
how much weight have you lost ? 
oh .  .  . nothing .   thirty pounds .   i just have n't been very hungry . 
how 's your wife ? 
when we divorce a decade ago she was very very angry .   now she 's just hostile . 
well for later then . 
what ? 
i used to live here . 
but you hated four out of the five you did . 
i was here six years .   and i only hated two . 
which ? 
the first and the last . 
sam 's favorite . 
what have you been before today ? 
it was just that maybe the way the sun struck the ocean the sound of the waves .  it was simple whatever it was .   then i started thinking about the last time i felt this good .   it 's been a long time . 
do you remember ? 
the only time i can think of for sure i was holding onto sam in the ocean saving him from the waves . 
we have it on video !   was that when ?   my parents were down for his sixth birthday !  i remember that . 
i 'm fine .   nothing .   i 'll drop by your lunch tomorrow . 
i dreamed about your house last night . 
finished or unfinished ? 
it was perfect george .   amazing .   it was so real . 
did n't you once dream you could lick people well though ? 
that was n't a dream .   that was sam . 
oh .  .  . with his ear infection ! 
my tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him . 
the antibiotics were n't working .   it 's what i believe george . 
hindsight .   it 's like foresight without a future . 
you 're not well . 
i was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring claude . 
that 's what respectable folks do .  get a job get married start having babies .  that 's what you want is n't it ? 
sure it is .  i just do n't see any reason to rush into things .  damn look at this shirt .  i 'll be right back . 
but i 'm having a good time .  .  . 
of course i did .  he said he 'd file an appeal right away .  you did n't tell me he was so good looking . 
yeah that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains .  i hope he do n't mess things up . 
he seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me .  his offices take up an entire floor of that big new building on 125th street and he was using all these words i never heard before .  he even offered me a job . 
a job huh ?  well that 's nice real nice .  you wo n't have to work long .  i 'll be back soon enough .  after i start work at first federal bank of manhattan i 'll be keeping you in style .  everything will get back to normal again .  that 's a promise .

oh that 's a cinch .  i 'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay . 
sure  sure .  do n't you worry .  i 'll take care of you . 
over by that hill . 
look bob ! 
all of it .  father perrault and his magnificent history .  this place hidden away from the rest of the world with its glorious concepts and now you come along and confuse me entirely . 
i 'm sorry .  i thought i was to be the light .  but why do i confuse you ?  am i so strange ? 
on the contrary you 're not strange .  and that in itself is confusing .  i have the same idea about shangri la .  the sense that i 've been here before that i belong here . 
i 'm so glad . 
i ca n't quite explain it but everything is somehow familiar .  the very air that i breathe .  the lamasery with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley while its head explores the eternal .  all the beautiful things i see these cherry blossoms you  all somehow familiar .   i 've been kidnapped and brought here against my will .  a crime a great crime yet i accept it amiably with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend .  why ?  can you tell me why ? 
perhaps because you 've always been a part of shangrila without knowing it . 
i wonder . 
i 'm sure of it .  just as i 'm sure there 's a wish for shangrila in everyone 's heart .  i have never seen the outside world .  but i understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy .  yet i just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security where there 's beauty and comfort where they would n't have to be mean and greedy .  oh i just wish the whole world might come to this valley . 
then it would n't be a garden spot for long . 
bump ? 
when the plane lands at shangrila and wakes us all up . 
you see it 's not a dream . 
you know sometimes i think that it 's the other that 's the dream .  the outside world .  have you never wanted to go there ? 
goodness no .  from what you tell me about it it certainly does n't sound very attractive . 
it 's not so bad really .  some phases are a little sordid of course .  that 's only to be expected . 
why ? 
oh the usual reasons .  a world full of people struggling for existence . 
struggling why ? 
well everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself accumulate a nest egg and so on . 
why ? 
you know if you keep on asking that we 're not going to get anywhere .  and do n't ask me why . 
i was just going to . 
it 's the most annoying word in the english language .  did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it ?   mother 's little darling mus n't stick her fingers in the salad bowl .  why ?  because it is n't lady like to do that .  why ?  because that 's what forks are made for darling . 
why mother ? 
because mother read it in a book somewhere and if mother 's little darling does n't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant mother 's going to wring her little neck . 
i 'd love it ! 
why ? 
forgiven .   you know when we were on that plane i was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it .  that silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys covering ten times the distance of the plane .  it was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed .  and i 've been thinking that somehow you 're that plane and i 'm that silly shadow .  that all my life i 've been rushing up and down hills leaping rivers crashing over obstacles never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms . 
how could i know that a war was going to break out right over my head !   right over my head .  oh my word !  i tell you those chinese were pouncing on me from every direction .  i had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape . 
i tell you we 're going west and shanghai is east of here ! 
be quiet !  fenner 's the best pilot in china .  he knows what he 's doing . 
it 's fenner . 
i do n't know .  i 'm a paleontologist not a foreign secretary . 
mountain grass .  it 's good too .  here have some .  i 've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff . 
english ! 
what do we do ?     lean into it . 
what the hell does that mean ? 
actually .  .  .  i do n't know . 
out of focus ? 
the only thing i could think of would be .  .  .  you 'd have to get rid of the queen . 
what if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is ? 
are you sure you do n't ? 
they respond to fear right ? 
yeah  .  .  .   ? 
well i 'm going to give them something to be afraid of . 
no . 
maybe you need a closer look . 
you figured what ? 
i figured it did n't matter .   it 's my last day of business .    i was wrong .   i 'm sorry .   hey look what i got for you a freefloating plasma pad ?  one of the good ones too with zoids . 
i understand .   i understand thank you .  how about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser ? 
yes .   yes that 's eminently fair of you . 
and i 'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me
you 're not taking me in ! 
how could it not ? 
why do n't you ask the mosebacke ?      brazil .  until 44 years ago they ate with their hands lived in huts and did n't even know the rest of the world existed .  44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork .   today they do n't exist . 
come on now .   people are smart . 
no a person is smart .   people are dumb .     and the more people you put together the dumber they get .   and you know that . 
beauty ?   the precogs do n't even always agree with each other ! 
no doubt . 
then go ahead pull the trigger . 
armor up  sicksticks and concussion guns  this is gonna be close . 
you 're kidding that 's today ? 
i wrote it down in your calendar then left a message at your house 
all i need some twink from the fed poking around right now .   check again with the paper they had it forwarded .   see if the neighbors know where they went check all relations 
uh sir .  .  .

i know .   he came to me told me about the missing data stream .   he was concerned that you might find it . 
i did find it .   it was inside of agatha all this time .   so the question is why would someone want this erased from the data file ? 
danny tell me what you 're thinking . 
i 'm thinking someone got away with murder . 
how ? 
yes .  .  .  it 's called an echo .   the act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the precogs . 
precog deja vu .  .  . 
we teach the tech 's to identify them and disregard .  .  . 
yes .

soho . 
yeah .  i 'll find it .  it 's in harlem . 
harlem ?  what is it a restaurant ? 
you do n't know where you 're going ? 
no .  just the cross streets . 
well this is the corner . 
no .  that 's cool man . 
yeah . 
depends what night . 
you know white kids with trust funds acting like they 're poor .  keeping it real .  know what i mean ?

taken care of ? 
yeah he 's getting there on his own . 
we 're going to new york ? 
yes .  you 're going to new york . 
and the money .  where do we bring the money ? 
that money is your per diem . 
and where do we bring it ? 
you will not carry any other pagers with you .  you will not carry anything for that matter that i have not just given you . 
keys . 
what ? 
what about my keys ? 
you can carry your keys .  you will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ .  you will not speak to anyone while you are working .  when you are not working you are considered to be on call' and available twentyfour hours a day .  this means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner .  there is already a number in your pager 's memory .  it is a car service .  when they ask you what account you will respond cardiff giant . they will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go .  in other words there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes .  do you see a pattern forming ? 
yes . 
tell me . 
do n't worry .  i get it . 
so tell me how it is .

yeah .  that fernet tastes like tar .  my grandfather tried to give me that . 
some fuckin guineas he sent me .  it 's midnight and the motherfucker 's ordering an apertif . 
it 's a digestif . 
maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you 're working right ? 
she poured it for 
far as she knows you 're john gotti .  now put the shit down and act like you got some ass . 
unless spoken to ai n't that right horrace .  did n't you say that ? 
four mimosas .   you 'll love them .  so here 's the plan .  i did n't say shit to maxie cause the man has acute angina and i do n't want to get him all worked up . 
he has a cute what .  .  .  ? 
i 'm tired of praying . 
that 's enough brother earl . 
let 's get out of this cold . 
malcolm where are you ?  we 've been calling all over the city . 
let some of us come down there . 
no that wo n't be necessary .  i 'll be all right . 
i wish you 'd listen to us .  what about the meeting tomorrow ?  we need to frisk people . 
i do n't want folks to be searched it makes people uncomfortable .  if i ca n't be safe among my own kind where can i be ?  allah will protect me . 
so now we have no opening speaker ?  why was n't i informed last night ? 
i called sister betty she did n't tell you ? 
since when do you start telling sister betty my business ?  since when ?  she has nothing to do with this .  you tell me not her not anybody else . 
i assumed .  .  . 
what did i tell you about assuming ? 
the way i feel i ought not to go out there today .  in fact i 'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself  that 's all a part of the white man's big maneuver to keep us fighting amongst ourselves against each other .  i 'm not fighting anyone that 's not what we 're here for . 
let 's cancel . 
is my family here yet ? 
down front as always . 
preacher take your tin jesus and the virgin mary both and shove em . 
you 've been talking about the disciples .  what color were they ? 
i do n't think we know for certain . 
that 's right . 
as jesus was .  jesus was also a hebrew . 
just what is your question ? 
what color were the original hebrews ? 
i told you we do n't know for certain . 
then we do n't know that god was white . 
but we do know that the people of that region of asia minor from the tigriseuphrates valley to the mediterranean are darkskinned people .  i 've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels .  i have never seen a native of that area who was not black . 
just what are you saying ? 
i 'm not saying anything preacher .  i 'm proving to you that god is black . 
listen !  i will give you a life for a life . 
what do you mean ? 
her life for your life . 
you 're a liar .  pinta 's dead . 
i 'm a businessman .  a dead girl is worth nothing .  she is alive . 
and one of the founding members of la hermanidad . 
correct ! 
it 's all up to you commandante .  tell me about you and the dreamer' . 
lucky how ? 
that he used policemen .  that you killed them it made it a police matter .  the ramos family could n't refuse our involvement . 
and ? 
and i had my men ready . 
you stole the drop . 
o . k .  so tell me more . 
there was no ten million dollars . 
the ransom was ten . 
two and a half .  that 's how much there was . 
do n't lie to me ! 
two and a half !  the rest was paper !  strips of paper ! 
no .  whoever took the rest took it before the exchange . 
who gave the bags to ramos ? 
his lawyer .  jordan kalfus . 
that 's what everybody keeps saying . 
yes . 
show me please . 
nine millimeter .  a sig sauer 226 . 
have you used this type before ? 
i think it 's fantastic . 
you realize that you 've brought a killer into the house . 
hmm ? 
creasy .  pinta likes him . 
pinta loves school .  she 'd like count dracula is he took her back there . 
what ?  who ? 
creasy . 
why ?  you were so pleased with him . 
pinta likes him too much .   she thinks of him as a father . 
that 's ridiculous . 
it 's not . 
he has to go . 
she 's young .  she 'll get over it . 
i was n't thinking of pinta . 
is that good or bad ? 
that 's good .  really good .  he shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack .  they 're saying he 's responsible . 
he sounded strong to me .  stronger than we are . 
we did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings including the little girl .  the same man the dreamer' .  listen to this . 
creasy is not a policeman .  my sense is he could be very valuable to us . 
it 's a moral issue .  on one hand you 're cleaning up the bad guys but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys . 
i heard you ma . 
she looks a little old for you .  about thirtyfive forty years old ? 
she 's twentynine ma .

funnier things have happened .  ma says when pa was courting her he acted strange for months .  did n't make senseor anything .  and one day on a hunch ma said clayton so help me you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear .  not the collar mary he said my shoes .  well for land 's sake ma said take the pesky things off !  which pa did an' they were engaged within a week .

it 's wonderful . 
to most people it 's an awful letdown . 
huh ? 
i say to most people it 's a washout . 
that depends on what they see . 
now what do you see ? 
me ?   oh i see a small ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier .  i see thousands of marching men .  i see general lee with a broken heart surrendering and i can see the beginning of a new nation like abraham lincoln said .  and i can see that ohio boy being inaugurated as president  things like that can only happen in a country like america . 
you can almost spit on it ca n't you ? 
why do n't you try ? 
i 'm not worrying any more .  i suppose they 'll go on writing them till they get tired .  you do n't believe all that stuff do you ? 
yeah i guess so .  what puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other .  why do n't they try liking each other once in a while ? 
yeah .  anyway there are n't any photographers around . 
what 's that ? 
you said i was a lady in distress . 
oh that

oh they insisted on following me . 
what do you think bodyguards are for ? 
what do they mean by this  cinderella man ! 
are those stories true ? 
they 'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance .  they 've got you down as a sap . 
i think i 'll go down and punch this editor on the nose . 
no you do n't !  get this clear socking people is no solution for anything . 
sometimes it 's the only solution . 
not editors .  take my word for it .  not editors ! 
if they 're going to poke fun at me i 'm going to
listen .  listen longfellow .  you 've got brains kid .  you 'll get along swell if you 'll only curb your homicidal instincts  and keep your trap shut .  do n't talk to anybody !  these newshounds are out gunning for you . 
but what about this cinderella man ? 
that 's my job .  i 'll take care of that .  i 'll keep that stuff out of the papers  if you 'll help me .  but i ca n't do anything if you go around talking to people .  will you promise me to be careful from now on ? 
yes i guess i 'll have to . 
thank you .   if you feel the building rock it 'll be me blasting into this editor . 
it could happen .  what about his state certification exams ?  the records seem to be in order . 
oh for god 's sake phyllis  we have no reason to doubt the man !  are we listening to lionel now ? 
no dr .  delbanco it is i who am sorry .  sorry to have wasted your time with such .  .  . 
i do n't think you know dr .  sheeler .  she 's the other therapist here in town . 
of course .  .  .  i 've heard great things about you . 
right now ? 
are we ? 
i think i 've heard of him .  .  .  a disciple of rothberg was n't he ? 
dorothy fowler .  fantastic woman .  she passed last year in a train wreck .  damned amtrak . 
my approach ? 
how do you mean ? 
of course . 
is something wrong sofie ? 
yes something 's very wrong dr .  mumford . 
you 're upset . 
how intuitive !  that must take years of training right there .  maybe you can guess what has upset me . 
no it is not something i 've heard about you !  it is someth  why ?  is there something i should have heard about you ? 
why do n't you tell me what 's on your mind ? 
umhuh . 
first of all i have been feeling much better lately .  i do n't know if the syndrome is over  if it 's just run its course or something  but i feel a hundred per cent better than when i first came to you . 
i 'm glad . 
given that i 'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way . 
i do n't follow you . 
i 'm saying that since i 'm doing so much better  which i attribute to you  i 'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings . 
okay .  .  . 
the point is this  i am not a blank page .  i did not just fall off the turnip truck .  do you know what i mean ? 
i think so . 
i know a little about psychology .  i took three different courses in college .  it 's true none of them were above the two hundred level but i took them .  .  .  and there was one concept i remember very well . 
what was that ? 
transference ! 
transference . 
yes and that is what i have got right now .  i have taken my feelings of gratitude .  .  .  and relief .  .  .  and transferred them onto .  .  .  you .  i have taken all those warm grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you .  .  .  so that now i am under the delusion .  .  .    .  .  . that i am in love with you . 
hello . 
i think you can understand why i have some serious questions about your methods .  i mean obviously it becomes much more likely that i 'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make outsville and do all these highly romantic activities 
what do you think i 'm after mrs .  cook ? 
which show was that ? 
sofie .  .  . 
part of it .  we were watching er until someone called . 
you probably got the idea . 
you 're not the only one .  .  . 
not me .  .  .  all my other my patients .  i smelled tar and feathers on the way over here . 
you deserve it . 
but .  .  . 
but nothing .  .  .  i 'm mad as hell .  this is a terrible thing you 've done . 
i know it !  please believe me i know that .  .  . 
intestines . 
yeah !  them . 
when ramesses destroyed syria it was an accident .  you are a catastrophe !  why do i put up with you ? 
who needs smart women ?  i put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons allah rest their souls .  now straighten up this mess ! 
perhaps . 
what is he doing here ? 
do you truly wish to know ?  or would you prefer to just shoot us ? 
to have stopped this creature ?  yes ! 
it is because it was you who read from the book .  he has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of ancksunamun . 
 then perhaps the golden book of the living can return them to the underworld . 
exactly 
no !  she has seen too much .  she knows too much . 
yes .  no one has ever had so much been so close .  we must stop her or it will be the end of us all . 
then we will kill her we will kill her and all those with her . 
and burn the map and retrieve the key . 
it will be done .  but what of the american expedition ?  they leave tomorrow as well . 
forget the bumbling americans they will be like all the others .  without the map to guide them how can they possibly find hamunaptra ? 
owch !  that 's really got to hurt . 
no kiddin' without a key it 'll take us a month to crack this thing
yes i 'm all tears now let 's see who 's inside shall we ? 
what are you going to do ?  shoot him ? 
if he decides to wake up hell yes ! 
rat gizzards .  they smell bad and taste worse but that 's the best the desert has to offer . 
must of got a little too frisky with the pharaoh 's daughter . 
that 's one of the plagues right ?  the grasshopper plague ! 
the guy !  the priest !  the mummy ! 
ya know ever since i met you my luck has been for crap . 
yes i know i do that to people . 
and then he 'll be coming after evy . 
yeah . 
but we know they 're out there .  hundreds  maybe thousands of lonely unknown superheroes who desperately need a cause .  .  . 
i used to believe that .  now i 'm not so sure . 
but there 's still only six of us . 
so what ? 
he 's got the fact that he 's superman ! 
because that 's what it is . 
but i just do n't feel it . 
okay you win .  i 'm pissed off .  i 'm seriously peeved . 
are you coming or not ? 
i 'll drive . 
not a chance ! 
with what ? 
i very much doubt that he will . 
oh .  .  .  ? 
i 'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle . 
i see . 
my dear francis you do seem extremely uncomfortable . 
i 'm afraid i am just a bit . 
would you like some brandy ? 
thank you . 
i 'll have the fire built up . 
francis may i ask whether you wear warm winter underwear ? 
ah well that is the first rule of warfare .   you must wear longsleeved and longlegged underwear .   you can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom . 
good evening mademoiselle . 
yes it is .   it must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter . 
yes it must be . 
yes i am sir . 
then what brings you out on such a night ? 
well one must do something to live you know  and i have an elderly mother who depends on me . 
oh i see .  .  .  that must be a great burden . 
one must take life as it comes  do you live in lyon sir ? 
no i 'm only here on leave .   my regiment is at valence . 
are you staying with a friend sir ? 
no .  .  .  i have a .  .  .  room .  .  .  at the hotel de perrin . 
is it a nice warm room sir ? 
well it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street . 
would you like to take me there so that we can get warm sir ? 
uhhh .  .  .  yes of course  if you would like to go .  .  .  there .  .  .  but .  .  .  i have very little money .

oh i 'm sorry about that . 
lisette .

lisette la croix .

oh yes .  .  .  of course . 
to citizen general bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife .   you should know citizen general that your wife has taken a lover one captain hippolyte charles .  .  .  undated and unsigned .

you do n't know baby d . 
that 's the sister . 
yo know what ?   i 'm starting to like rancho cucamonga . 
i know what cha thinking .   i thought the same thing .   but it ca n't happen . 
why ? 
because it 's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy .   and i 'm just trying to keep the peace .   we moved out here to get away from that shit . 
what you mean so ? 
if you get into it' with them s . a . s and start a feud you can always go back to home .   i gotta live here .   just remember that .

i said i have to do something . 
i 'll have you out of here in two shakes o 'f a lamb 's tail . 
is within himself .

i remember .  the big tipper .

oh man .  .  . 
please .  something is going to happen .  .  . 
what ?  the end of the world ?  man do n't give me your mad rap .  i 'm not a bartender .  i do n't want to hear it .  i raise a family doing this bullshit .  do me a favor .  get your crazy white ass out of my chair . 
please .  .  . 
hey a big tip does n't give you the right to crap in my ear .  you want change ?   you got it brother .  what was that you gave me a twenty ? 
i 'm not dragging you into anything .  i do n't expect .  .  . 
cover your mouth . 
what ? 
this gorilla 's watching you is that right ? 
that 's right . 
then do n't let him be seeing you talking to me .  i do n't want him twisting my arm off . 
in twentyfive minutes in the california ballroom . 
there was a woman .  she was trying to help me .  i watched him murder her . 
what are you supposed to do ? 
kill the governor . 
one of them is in on it .  he might even be in charge .  her security is in on it .  there 's only one person i know for sure is n't in on it . 
who ? 
the governor .  if i could just talk to her .  .  . 
oh jesus  .  .  . 
no way there 's nothing you can do to help me . 
it 's my kid .  i 've got to .  .  . to somehow .  .  . do right by my little girl . 
yeah all right listen .  .  . 
so when she wanted a divorce .  .  . i was .  .  . i did n't know what i 'd done wrong .  i did n't see it .  i did n't see it .  .  .  . 
i 'm sorry .  you understand i do n't mind dying if i could save my daughter .  i mean that . 
yeah now listen .   i ca n't mess with these shoes any more or it 's gonna look funny .  you go down get yourself something to drink .  make sure godzilla there follows you . 
what are you going to do ? 
i know you did reverend .  oh i know how you tried ! 
the devil wins sometimes ! 
want me to take em up and wash em good ? 
thank you no .  thank you dear icey .  i 'll tend to them .  thank you . 
there !  what 's so hard about that ! 
who 's them blue men yonder ? 
blue men . 
you better not sing that song . 
why ? 
'cause you 're too little . 
once upon a time there was a rich king .  .  .    .  .  . and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in africa .  well one day this king got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold and before long these bad men come back and 
the blue men ? 
'night miss jenny do n't let the bedbugs bite . 
sshhh .  .  . 
hm ? 
when mr .  powell 's our daddy then i can tell him about 
john !  do n't ! 
you promised dad you would n't never tell ! 
uhoh .  .  . 
it 's nothing too hard or anything .   i 'm just going to .  .  .  look for someone and .  .  .  i want you to be sort of a .  .  .  guard .  okay ? 
okay okay .   i think . 
shhh .  now listen here 's what we 're gonna do .  .  . 
just checking  keep out of sight ! 
and if you ca n't do that you sleep . 
used to .  not anymore . 
no . 
they got a whole system they call dream skills' .  so if you have a nightmare for instance like falling right ? 
yeah . 
instead of screaming and getting nuts you say okay i 'm gonna make up my mind that i fall into a magic world where i can get something special like a poem or song .   they get all their art literature from dreams .  just wake up and write it down .  dream skills . 
they turn their back on it .   takes away its energy and it disappears . 
what happens if they do n't do that ? 
i guess those people do n't wake up to tell what happens . 
great . 
i found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on ventura . 
well what you reading it for ? 
hi . 
oh .  hi how y 'doing ? 
i heard your ma went ape at the security store today .  you look like the prisoner of zenda or something .  how long 's it been since you slept ? 
coming up on the seventh day .  it 's okay i checked guiness .  the record 's eleven and i 'll beat that if i have to .   listen i .  .  .  i know who he is . 
who ? 
the killer . 
you do ? 
yeah and if he gets me i 'm pretty sure you 're next . 
where is your courage comrade buljanoff ? 
we 'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe .  that 's a perfect excuse .  there was no other safe big enough . 
they accumulate millions by taking loss after loss . 
but what can we do ?  .  .  .  we have to accept . 
we like you leon  do n't we like leon ? 
what is it ? 
a telegram from moscow !  it must have been here all day ! 
yes he looks like a comrade ! 
for ourselves .  .  .  we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters . 
and they might believe her in moscow . 
what do you mean they might  they will ! 
leon how would you like to have three lifelong friends ? 
we did our best comrade . 
i hope so for your sake .   let us examine the case .  what does the lawyer say ? 
i will not repeat your mistake .  i will have no dealings with the grand duchess nor her representative . 
we did it with the best intentions .  .  . 
we cannot feed the russian people on your intentions .  fifty per cent to a socalled duchess !  .  .  .  half of every loaf of bread to our enemy !  comrade kopalski go at once to our embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in paris . 
yes comrade . 
you comrade iranoff go to the public library and get me the section of the civil code on property . 
oh yes power and light .  thank you . 
no not a thing .  would you like to go out ? 
well we 're back home . 
sssh !  once and for all we 're in moscow ! 
yes there 's no doubt of that .  .  .   just look out of the window and there it is . 
and it 's great !  think what it was a few years ago and what it is now . 
even the swallows are back . 
yes a good piece of apfel strudel .  .  .  . 
we will get that .  .  .  we 'll get everything .  .  .  maybe a little bit later but we 'll get it .  .  .  we must be patient .  .  .  finally we got the spring did n't we ?  we got the swallows and you will get your apfel strudel too . 
do n't make it difficult for me .  this is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you . 
you were very careless with our precious jewels my dear .  they 're too expensive a toy for two children to play with . 
where are they ? 
do n't worry .  fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open .  perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a russian .   i just put this on for sentiment .  the rest are absolutely safe .  i assure you .  but if you feel like notifying the police .  .  . 
you leave me no choice . 
wo n't it be rather embarrassing for a soviet envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them ? 
i will have to face the consequences but so will you .  do n't forget they will ask how you got them . 
that 's very simple to answer .  they were given to me by my mother .  they were given to her by her mother in fact they 're mine you cannot steal what belongs to you ! 
i told you we had plenty to talk about .  shall we sit down ? 
in other words moral ideas have no weight with you .  .  .  all right then let 's deal with legal facts .  you know that france has recognized the soviet . 
unfortunately . 
under soviet law the jewels belong to the state .  france is going to uphold that ownership . 
my lawyer agrees with you .  he says france will uphold it in every court but i will drag you through every court do n't forget that .  and when i say it will take two years i am as always conservative . 
wo n't those two years in court be expensive for you ?  i know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people but now .  .  . 
i may run out of money but you have already run out of bread .  two years is a long time for your comrades to wait . 
i see .  you have calculated in terms of hunger . 
no i just wanted to be absolutely impartial .  both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years .  we can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition .  ninotchka now realizes what she is after . 
go on . 
i am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that fiveforty plane to moscow . 
that 's not the way to win him back .  .  .  not leon . 
i think i know leon quite as well as you .  .  .  possibly a little better .  leave that worry to me .  fiveforty leaves you time enough to close the deal with monsieur mercier but naturally you 'll be too busy for any farewells .  i 'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and i will also see you to the airport .  that 's my proposition comrade yakushova . 
what do you want ? 
may i have your bags madame ? 
why ? 
that 's no business .  .  .  that 's a social injustice . 
that depends on the tip . 
good morning comrade commissar .  here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months . 
does this include the products of the far eastern provinces ? 
yes it does . 
you mean you have finished the whole investigation ? 
yes . 
that 's marvelous .  .  .  .  you must have worked day and night .  .  .  .  do n't you ever sleep ? 
i need very little sleep .  we must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange .  i have already started a survey of our most urgent needs . 
well comrade i am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else . 
may i ask why ? 
please .  .  .  sit down . 
thank you . 
well comrade have you heard from your friends kopalski buljanoff and iranoff ? 
no . 
i have n't either but i 've heard about them .  you must realize it was only on the strength of your paris report that i sent them to constantinople without that i never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal . 
may i ask what has happened ? 
as soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance .  if i told you what 's going on in constantinople right now you would n't believe it .  those three have been sitting there for six weeks and have n't sold a piece of fur .   this anonymous report was sent me .  they are dragging the good name of our country through every caf and night club .  here .  .  .   how can the bolshevik cause gain respect among the moslems if your three representatives buljanoff iranoff and kopalski get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it did n't fly ? 
it gives details which could n't be invented .  naturally i want to verify it and that 's why i need you . 
you want me to go to constantinople ? 
yes .  .  .  leaving immediately . 
i appreciate the confidence you show in me but i must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission .  i should hate to interrupt my present work .  i am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne . 
that is for me to decide comrade yakushova . 
i am sorry i do n't want to overstep my position  but please .  .  .  do n't send me . 
i do n't understand . 
how can i make myself clear .  .  .  it is difficult to express but i 'd rather not go to foreign countries any more .  please comrade .  .  .  let me stay here .  .  .  let me finish my work .  .  .  i am in the rhythm of it now .  .  .  i do n't want to go away .  i do n't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again .  it throws one out of gear .  .  .  .  let me finish my work .  .  .  i have concentrated everything in it .  .  .  please .  .  .  do n't make me go . 
please do n't waste my time comrade .  do your duty .  goodby . 
i will do my best . 
this will do .  
i think this is the first time you have been to my little place .  your face is new to me .  now what shall it be ? 
raw carrots and beets . 
oh madame !  this is a restaurant not a meadow . 
but madame !  if you do n't think about food what do you think about ? 
the future of the common people . 
that also is a question of food madame .  i 'll bring you a nice little lunch  la pre mathieu .  
you never told him ? 
i did n't want him to get the credit .  he said i 'd stabbed him in the back .  called me a twobit grocery clerk from whittier . 
they had us bugged .   christ he had everybody bugged .   yeah he was gonna support me in '68 but he was also threatening me .   that was hoover he 'd give you the carrot but he 'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass . 
money .   follow the money . 
sir ? 
these kids are being manipulated by the communists .   like chambers and hiss . 
i tell you the soldiers were provoked .   now stop this pussyfooting around .   dead kids !   how the hell did we ever give the democrats a weapon like this ?   i mean if cambodia does n't work we 'll bomb hanoi if we have to . 
no  .  .  .  a little deficit wo n't hurt .  jesus they 're serious .   why 're we stopping ? 
run em over . 
probably flunking nothing to do except come down here and meet girls .  henry 's out there with them . 
there 's a poison in the upper classes bob .   they 've had it too soft .   too many cars too many color tvs  .  .  . 
do n't forget the south sir the west .  filled with the good football colleges straight kids .   there 's more of em with you than against you .   not like these mudmutts . 
it 's the parents' fault really . 
yeah we 've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit .   that 's top priority . 
it 's okay bob we 're just rapping my friends and i .   we actually agree on a lot of things  .  .  .

i said i 'll think about it .

sell that .  i figured it could only have painful associations for wash . 
it was in his bureau . 
you did n't know that at the time ! 
so i borrowed it till i did know ! 
that do n't make no sense ! 
pete it 's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart .  what the hell 's that singing ? 
pete do n't be ignorant
for him not for the law !  i 'm surprised at you pete .  hell i gave you credit for more brains than delmar . 
join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition ?  thank you anyway .   and i like the smell of my hair treatment  the pleasing odor is half the point . 
million point two . 
what about you delmar ?  what 're you gonna do with your share a that dough ? 
well that hardly sounds like you .  .  . 
pete the personal rancor reflected in that remark i do n't intend to dignify with comment but i would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism .  consider the lilies a the goddamn field orhell !  take a look at delmar here as your paradigm a hope . 
lynette watch your mouth !  somebody might overhear . 
paula look at the new poopies . 
yeah i saw em .  poor guys . 
see you in a month when you get liberty ! 
do n't worry .  it grows out about an inch by them . 
come on .  let 's go dance . 
i got my foot on the floor . 
great . 
details pokrif .  from what i saw he had an incredible body . 
yeah .  .  .  mmmm .  .  . 
what did he do ?  did he do anything that was different ? 
everything was different . 
but in what ways ? 
big sid came in about two and a half seconds then had the nerve to ask did you make it too sweetheart ? '
no but i told him i 'd be at the town tavern next saturday night and he sounded like he might come . 
i told zack about saturday night too .  the fifth week 's supposed to be the roughest .  come wednesday he 'll be wishing he took my number . 
you hope . 
he 'll show .  i 'd bet my paycheck on it . 
i have n't made up my mind . 
what do you mean ? 
you know what i mean .  would you .  .  .  let yourself get pregnant ? 
no way .  .  .  would you ? 
i never used to think i 'd do something like that but now i 'm not so sure .  you ask me nine weeks just ai n't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you . 
that do n't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant lynette !  nothing justifies that .  i ca n't believe you 're even thinking like that .  i mean that 's really backward . 
no more backward if you ask me than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us then ditch us .   do n't you ever feel used paula ?  do n't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it .  .  .  ? 
no .  i never feel like that . 
i do .

i thought maybe you did .  i know you do n't approve of the subject being raised

ah  he 's learned then .   plays things more close to the vest .  see jack was a cartographer back in old england .   somehow he came by the money to commission the pearl .  hired himself a crew promised each man an equal share .   so they 're forty days out and the first mate says everything 's an equal share that should mean the location of the island too .   so jack gave up the bearings .   that night there was a mutiny . 
how did he get off the island ? 
we 're not going to just surrender !

there 's an intelligent way to approach marriage . 
intelligence !  nothing has caused the human race more trouble .  modern marriage ! 
baloney !  once it was see somebody get excited get married  now it 's read books fence with four syllable words psychoanalyze each other until you ca n't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
people have different emotional levels that 
ask for trouble and you get it .  why there 's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years .  then he refused to marry her .  why ?   because she only scored sixtyone on a look magazine marriage quiz !

because .  .  .  well you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there .  .  .  tonight i was sort of tied up with steve .  .  .  but tomorrow i figured on doing just that . 
i have n't got the job yet . 
then do n't come sneakin' around a man's camp . 
a fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden he do n't take chances .  my name 's clayton and i 'm looking for someone . 
so did i .  they were in it . 
she 's a friend  took off this morning sort of sudden while i was n't around . 
hello miss wells . 
it would n't happen to be this .  .  . 
which ranch ? 
how 's that ? 
you 've got to  do n't you understand  they want me with them and they 'll fix it so i have to go 
no they wo n't . 
a little hot . 
i do n't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they do n't want to leave . 
a man i used to know . 
there 's plenty of use for reading  you 'll see . 
unicorn  a kind of animal 
what do they look like ? 
hmmm .  .  .  sort of like a horse  with a horn in the center of its forehead . 
horses with horns !  huh !  do we have em in nevada ? 
no . 
how about california ? 
would they be good to eat ? 
kind of tough i guess .  .  .  but you 're not liable to hunt them  i do n't think there 's any alive now anyways  and i 'm not sure but i do n't think there ever were .  .  . 
then if they was n't alive how can they be an animal ?  .  .  . 
you do n't read to fill your stomach .  .  .  poetry for instance .  all the poems in the world would n't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal  but they make you feel good . 
i feel good anyways . 
now i know what a unicorn is what do we do next ? 
oh i was n't worrying .   i saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave . 
and you 've got me all figured out ? 
sure . 
you were supposed to be reading words . 
i was doin' both .  here . 
but you 're his brother . 
he 'll treat his wife just as good .  maybe better .  ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers ? 
oh sure . 
let me do that . 
it 's a long ways yet .   i figure we ought to camp .  she 's tired . 
yes it was reported but never substantiated . 
i 'm glad you asked .  it actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story . 
professor you guys gotta see this .  dwight come here . 
it 's some kind of energy field .  we better record this . 
got my camera right here . 
that 's fantastic .  our first phenomenon .  this is going to be a great weekend .  you guys better get some sleep .  dwight and i will take over from here . 
theo did you see the animal ? 
what are you getting at professor ? 
only that if this cat did attack he 's less likely to come back if the two of you were let 's say together .  come on it 's college .  time for you two to experiment . 
there 's something going on in this house .  i 'm not crazy . 
yeah bitch give me my apple .  what 's gotten into you ? 
i would n't go that far . 
dr .  sutphin is your wife a big reader ? 
bird books mostly .  .  . 
suspect 's family is headed east on calverton .  .  .  . 
leave her alone chip .   i think it 's great she has a new beau beverly . 
and all that gore better had n't be interfering with your schoolwork . 
does n't threaten me honey .  i 'm happy . 
misty that 's a terrible thing to say !   detectives it 's time for you to leave .  my wife knows nothing about this terrible .  .  .  accident . 
both of you !  get in the car ! 
i ca n't believe i thought my own mother was a murderess ! 
misty sutphin get in this car !  ! 
that 's nice . 
nice ?  !  he should have been executed ! 
yes . 
no .  .  . at the morgue they told me a mr .  gregory ward had made inquiries about jacqueline . 
the morgue ?  no wonder you fainted .   i wish you had come to me first . 
then you know where jacqueline is ? 
but i 'd give a great deal to know . 
why ? 
i love your sister mary .  i love her very much . 
because i loved jacqueline i thought i knew her .  today i found out such strange things frightening things .  i saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging  waiting  i feel as if i 'd never known her . 
at least i can explain that mary .  your sister had a feeling about life  that it was n't worth living unless one could end it .  i helped her get that room . 
were n't you afraid ? 
afraid she might commit suicide ?   people who commit suicide do n't talk about it .  that room made her happy in some strange way i could n't understand .  she lived in a world of her own fancy .  she did n't always tell the truth .  in fact  i 'm afraid she did n't know what the truth was .   there were many things about jacqueline i did n't understand and yet without understanding i had to be with her  to see her  to touch her  in order to be happy .  it 's hard to explain to a youngster . 
i 'm not a youngster .  i can understand . 
good . 
but i reel guilty .  it does n't seem right for me to enjoy myself with jacqueline gone . 
thank you .  .   . goodnight . 
goodnight mary . 
but you do believe me ? 
the important thing is the police wo n't believe you . 
i saw him on the floor .  he was cut   here .  the blood was running out .  he was dead .  i 'm sure of it .  then on the subway i saw him  white  and the men holding him up between them . 
he was a kind little man in his way  and i made him go down that hall into the darkness .  i made him do it . 
drink your milk . 
but you have treated me that way . 
i wo n't do it again .  we 're friends .  i 'll never order you about again . 
a job ? 
you told me you were pretty good with youngsters .  today i bumped into an old friend of mine mrs .  wheeler  she runs a settlement house down in the village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher . 
i 'd like that . 
it 's not much money but it 's enough to live on .  you 'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room . 
maybe the romaris might have a room .  they seem nice . 
the people at the restaurant ? 
yes . 
oh i had business with a man .  .  .  but i missed him 
well i 'm glad you came to see me . 
shhh nancy .  the other children . 
no nancy . you 've got to sleep two more minutes . 
why
because i have something very important to do . 
what ? 
i 'll be right back with mrs .  wheeler . 
when ? 
i can quote it fully mrs .  redi .  we will avoid violence .  for once undertaken violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil . 
but he also wrote 
i can quote that too those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us and give knowledge of our being and our deeds whomsoever doeth this shall die . 
i know this is difficult for you .  i know that you love her . 
what about judd  he knows about us . 
then it is decided .  leo and durk and i will make our plans . 
we have n't even begun tea yet . 
i know .  you introduced jacqueline to us  but how could you tell 
i should have known .  she had no sincerity  no real belief . 
yes jacqueline .  you were always talking suicide   of ending your life when you wanted to . 
do you have to say that ? 
what ? 
you know what .  you say it just to irritate me . 
i say it because it 's descriptive . 
well he does n't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing anyway . 
ann you always underestimate me . 
well i wonder why . 
i think you 're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together .  i think you 're afraid he 'll be undeniably drawn to me . 
oh for god 's sake .  really cynthia really i do n't think he 's your type . 
my type ?  what is this bullshit ?  how would you know what my type is ? 
i have a pretty good idea . 
ann you do n't have a clue .  look i do n't even know why we 're discussing this i 'll just call him myself . 
he does n't have a phone . 
well i 'll call him when he does . 
but he wo n't . 
what are you talking about ? 
he 's not getting a phone he does n't like talking on the phone . 
oh please .  okay so give me the zen master 's address i 'll think of a reason to stop by . 
let me talk to him first . 
why ?  just give me the address you wo n't even have to be involved . 
i do n't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and .  .  . 
and what ? 
and .  .  .  do whatever it is you do . 
that goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune . 
are you getting mom something for her birthday ? 
i do n't know i 'll get her a card or something . 
a card ?  for her fiftieth birthday ? 
what 's wrong with that ? 
do n't you think she deserves a little more than a card ?  i mean the woman gave birth to you .  it 's her fiftieth birthday 
will you stop ?  jesus . 
i just thought it might 
okay ann okay .  how about this you buy her something nice and i 'll pay for half .  all right ? 
fine . 
good .  now if you 'll pardon me i have to go to work . 
i was thinking maybe i should n't be in therapy anymore . 
what do you mean he does n't want me to come over ?  did you tell him about me ? 
no i did n't . 
why not ? 
because i never got around to it . 
well why ? 
because .  cynthia look john was right .  graham is strange .  very strange .  you do n't want to get involved with him . 
what the hell happened over there ?  did he make a pass at you ? 
no ! 
then what 's the story what 's this strange bullshit all of a sudden ?  is he drowning puppies or what ? 
no it 's nothing like that . 
well what ?  is he dangerous ? 
no he 's not dangerous .  not physically . 
well what then ? 
i do n't want to talk about it . 
then why 'd you call me ? 
i do n't know . 
what kinds of questions ? 
questions about sex . 
well like what did he ask exactly ? 
oh so you 'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape but you wo n't tell your own sister ? 
apparently . 
did he ask you to take your clothes off ? 
cynthia ! 
what !  ? 
why did you do that ? 
because i wanted to . 
but why did you want to ? 
i wanted him to see me . 
cynthia who knows where that tape may end up ?  he could be .  .  .  bouncing it off some satellite or something .  some horny old men in south america or something could be watching it . 
he would n't do that . 
you do n't know that for sure . 
well it 's too late now is n't it ? 
did he touch you ? 
no but i did . 
you touched him ? 
you are in trouble . 
listen to you !  !  you sound like mom .  what are you talking about ? 
i ca n't believe you did that !  ! 
why ? 
i mean i could n't do that in front of john even . 
you could n't do it period . 
you know what i mean you do n't even know him ! 
i feel like i do . 
that does n't mean you do .  you ca n't possibly trust him he 's .  .  .  perverted . 
he 's harmless .  he just sits around and looks at these tapes .  what 's the big deal ? 
so he 's got this catalogue of women touching themselves ?  that does n't make you feel weird ? 
no .  i do n't think they all did what i did . 
you are in serious trouble . 
ann i do n't understand why this freaks you out so much .  you did n't do it i did and if it does n't bother me why should it bother you ? 
i do n't want to discuss it . 
then why do you keep asking about it ? 
what is it ? 
it 's a sun dress . 
it looks like a tablecloth . 
it does not . 
hold on . 
thirtytwo dollars . 
good !   i 'm gonna be there . 
of course . 
a wreck . 
check .   the quacks are willing tools ? 
fools ! 
i would n't mind doing janet one or two favours . 
time to check with flavors . 
what 's cookin' bert ? 
i tell you what 's cooking .   she made the blind see and it was a gift !   who was it from ?   let 's hear an f for .  .  . 
what ?

it 'll just take a second . 
you guys having fun ? 
good .  that 's good . 
just seeing how you 're doing .  and um mom and i were starting to look over the seating charts again and we 're wondering if you wanted tony levin to sit next to the feldmans or should he be at one of the singles tables ? 
well then put him at the singles table . 
the problem with that is that then there 's one extra 
then put him with the feldmans .  whatever you and your mom decide is fine with me . 
do n't dismiss me .  i 'm trying to include you in this decision .  he 's your friend . 
i did n't dismiss you .  i told you what i thought but it did n't seem to matter so you decide .  besides this is supposed to be my time with miles .  i hope you 're not going to call every five minutes . 
i 'm not going to call every five minutes but this is important . 
honey i 'm just saying you know i need a little space before the wedding .  is n't that the point of this ?  is n't that what we talked about with dr .  gertler ? 
i do n't know christine .  perhaps it 's because i feel attacked . 
i ask you one simple question and suddenly i 'm attacking you . 
listen .  i 'll call you when we get there and we can talk about it then okay ? 
bye . 
i love you . 
bye . 
hey evelyn it 's your favorite client . 
how 's the trip ? 
good good .  drinking some good wines and kicking back you know .  so what 's happening ?  still no word ? 
actually there is word .  i spoke to keith kurtzman this morning . 
and ? 
and .  .  .  they 're passing .  conundrum 's passing .  he said they really liked it .  they really wanted to do it but they just could n't figure out how to market it .  he said it was a tough call . 
huh . 
i 'm sorry miles .   so i do n't know where that leaves us .  i 'm not sure how much more mileage i can get out of continuing to submit it .  i think it 's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now  a fabulous book with no home .  the whole industry 's gotten gutless .  it 's not about the quality of the books .  it 's about the marketing . 
yeah . 
she 's working .  i need a break anyway .  she 's getting a little clingy .   this is our day ! 
nope . 
she likes you man .  stephanie 'll tell you . 
can you give me some room here ? 
oh yeah .  sure . 
thanks jack . 
you 're an asshole . 
nope . 
what do you think 's going on ? 
could be anything . 
been checking your messages ? 
obsessively . 
huh . 
they probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it 's not even worthy of a response .  i guess i 'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life . 
but you do n't know yet so your negativity 's a bit premature would n't you say ? 
shut up . 
just trying to be helpful .   it 's all about stillness miles .  inner quiet . 
why are you so hostile ?  i know you 're frustrated with your life right now but you can choose not to be so hostile .   here . 
i do n't know .  got it from stephanie . 
hey asshole !  that 's not cool ! 
throw me his ball . 
and i could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold out .  you are staying .  wendy ron and the twins are picking us up at 1130 to go to brunch at the sheraton .  they do a magnificent job there .  wendy is so excited you 're coming . 
just now .  she 's thrilled .  and the kids . 
yeah well .  you know jack 's pretty eager to get up to .  .  .  you know but uh yeah .  we 'll see how it goes . 
well you boys do what you want .  i just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday . 
uhhuh .   i 'll be right back . 
i just got divorced .  phyllis . 
please tie up isabelle to the back of the shed .  make sure the knot 's tight . 
i saw a monster .  can i have a glass of water ? 
it tastes old . 
only for pee or poop . 
right . 
why do you talk to mom when you 're by yourself ? 
does she ever answer back ? 
no . 
she does n't answer me either . 
this one ? 
a hair . 
this one ? 
morgan took a sip .  it has his amoebas in it . 
do n't worry . 
what book ! 
they 'll find a way in . 
posse ?  what the hell you talking about ? 
my partner and me robbed the bank in turley and headed out with a posse on our tails .  my partner there caught one a ways back and i think he kicked off while i was looking for this damn canyon .  you 're dawson ai n't you ?  i 'm tex larue .   used to ride with ry morris .  you know him .  well andy sims told me there was a hideout here so i headed for it .  hope you do n't mind . 
wait a minute !  if you do n't believe me ask them .  .  .    .  .  . they saw me and my pal in turley before we did the job . 
no money eh ? 
the money 's in my saddlebags over there but i ai n't stepping out to get it . 
what do you mean the horses ? 
howdy jake .  what 's going on here ? 
you got me .  this is a crazy town emmett .  i think we ought to get out of here . 
that 's why they got you in jail ? 
yeah i kissed a girl and this guy did n't like it and we had some words so i decided to get out of there . 
 .  .  . and you had to kill him ? 
no no no !  i winged him and he dropped his gun . 
you 're in here for winging a guy ? 
what friend is that ? 
the one with the shotgun . 
i just got to town . 
stella we still got an extra room out back do n't we ? 
luck i guess . 
good old paden .  i was hoping you 'd changed your mind about the job . 
you did n't tell me you owned a saloon . 
maybe we ought to ask stella . 
this is a lot of money . 
i told you this was a sweet setup . 
it is that . 
maybe you could run it without stella . 
well thanks but forget it . 
you know paden what makes all this work is me doing my job .  the fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble .  it 's going to take a little straightening out .  i have my responsibilities .  i want you to understand .  it has nothing to do with us . 
nothing .  do nothing .  do n't get between us . 
i 'm a great believer in doing nothing . 
so we understand each other ? 
do n't worry about me .  if you 're taking on emmett the last place i want to be is between you . 
yeah maybe i will too . 
i thought we talked about that . 
we did n't talk about this .   they took the little boy cobb . 
i saw how you 're putting mal johnson straight . 
cobb you 've got nothing i need . 
i 'm not thinking about your future paden .  i 'm worried about stella . 
what 's she got to do with it ? 
not a thing .  she 's just a mutual friend .   but if you wind up on the wrong side of this she 's going to get hurt . 
yeah .  bad luck .   goodbye cobb . 
goodbye paden . 
that 's the point hank .   no matter how good they are they 're still mickey mouse .   everyone 's tried .  everyone 's failed .   it ca n't be done . 
it can  with my new computer code you and me we can do it together . 
i do n't know anything about computers . 
that 's why you 're so perfect .   you have something i do n't have . 
what 's that ? 
an eye  for performance .   you know the truth when you see it .   i know .   i 've seen your movies .   i love your movies . 
you do ? 
straw god changed my life . 
you saw that ? 
i 've seen every frame of your work .  you 're the only filmmaker in hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision .  you and me art and science .  .  .  we are the perfect marriage . 
listen hank it 's been a rough day .   i 'll call you about his next week . 
i wo n't be here next week .   the tumor 's inoperable .   i 'll be dead . 
i 'm already dead . 
i just came out to support my good friend simone . 
there 's a rumor that you 're more than just good friends ? 
we 've been seeing each other sure but we 'd rather keep our relationship private . 
do i hear the sound of .  .  .  wedding bells ? 
i ca n't believe you people !   no wonder she never comes to these things ! 
hello sweetheart . 
it 's really .  .  .  not anything lainey .   it 's just 
do n't feel too bad .   mom runs the place and they still walk all over her .   you 're better off out of it . 
you look very grown up .   what are you doing ?   you meeting your mom for dinner ? 
i know you 'll do it dad .   you 're viktor taransky . 
hello lainey . 
she 's at the premiere of a cold day in hell .   but i think she send someone from acquisitions . 
she still with kent ? 
this week anyhow . 
 you finished the film on your own terms that 's what matters .  did you really do all the post yourself ? 
there was no other way . 
i missed you .   i wondered if you were ever coming back . 
me too . 
well i ca n't wait to meet simone .  .  .  what 's her last name ? 
you know i .  .  .  do n't know . 
is she here tonight ? 
she ca n't watch herself . 
i saw her picture on the er .  .  .  internet .   you really did n't notice anything  unusual ? 
only her brilliance .   to be honest with what you had to work with i was expecting a train wreck .   you really pulled it off . 
why ? 
those things can be dangerous .  staring at a screen all day  you miss what 's going on outside in the real world .   you can lose yourself .  you should get out more .   how are you going to meet boys ? 
i know plenty of boys . 
really ?   who ?   where do you meet them ?   in a chat room ?   how do you know he 's not some middleaged freak ? 
dad i can spot a middleaged freak a mile away . 
okay .   but you have to find a way to escape that thing . 
i do . 
how ? 
i read . 
you do ?   still ?   i ca n't tell you how happy i am to hear that . 
you were the one who insisted on it .   reading me dostoyevsky and joyce when i was four . 
you understood them .   that 's what was amazing .   it 's a nice day .   let 's eat outside . 
no walking around like regular people .  .  .  they ca n't see each other .  some of them do n't know they 're dead . 
they do n't know they 're dead ? 
all the time .  they 're everywhere .   you wo n't tell anyone my secret right ? 
will you stay here till i fall asleep ? 
what ? 
tommy tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial .  he thought everybody was selfconscious and unrealistic .  he said the play sucked big time . 
i know every child is special in their own way but tommy sounds like a punk .   i thought the play was excellent .  better than cats . 
cats ? 
never mind . 
and the tiny hairs on your arm .  are they all standing up ? 
them ? 
yes . 
what do you want more than anything ? 
i do n't know . 
i told you what i want . 
i do n't know cole . 
why do n't you think about it for a while ? 
when ? 
soon .  one week . 
do n't fail me . 
do n't give up .  you 're the only one who can help me .  i know it . 
the sheriff ?  !  we do n't need the sheriff !  !  !  we need to get the hell out of here ! 
depends .  you got some nerve intruding on a man's grief .  i bet i could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide .  now who are you ? 
you know who i am .  you invited me . 
ai n't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years .  my boy was taken from me .  .  .  far as i 'm concerned he 's dead .  now i ai n't gonna ask you again .   who are you ?  ! 
joseph macdonald .  .  .  your son . 
joseph macdonald .  damn right boy .  and do n't you forget it . 
broke her heart you never visited .  .  .  but i always said you 'd come back . 
 .  .  . guess it was her time to go .  you ca n't argue .  .  .  when the good lord calls you home . 
pardon ? 
aunt edith .  how did she .  .  .  die ? 
this is his room .  .  .  is n't it ? 
was .  you ai n't afraid of ghosts now are you ? 
i 'll be fine here . 
maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel . 
i would n't pay jesse no mind at all .  she 's just a crazy old woman .  has n't been right in the head since her husband passed away .   was n't much right before that neither . 
she was talking about .  .  .  a harvest of blood .  .  . 
blood ? 
i do n't think so . 
your momma was n't too proud when you came out neither wally . 
what the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital bill ? 
listen you got any reports of .  .  .  i do n't know what you call em .  they look like big slugs only fast .

and if we do n't they 're gonna be riding high in a brand new kenworth . 
i do n't know man .  ask him ? 
we gotta let the slack out cledus this is costing us time . 
if you ask me i think we should make that run to choo choo town and pick up that load of lumber .  nice .  easy .  and within the law . 
also boring . 
but i still do n't think .  .  . 
running blocker . 
go . 
now if i say go to channel three it really means go to six . 
six .  got it . 
if i say go to twentyone go to nineteen . 
twentyone is nineteen . 
if i say go to two it 's really one . 
two is one .   listen let 's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime .  start in the basement .  now let 's haul ass . 
i 'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you .  keep both feet on the floor .  we 'll be moving ninety and over . 
bandit ? 
yeah ? 
why are we doing this ? 
because they said it could n't be done . 
pull your hammer back smokey 's coming at you . 
okay we got a straight shot to t town so let her roll . 
that 's cause we 're damn near an hour ahead of schedule . 
let 's keep it that way . 
redneck heaven . 
look at that we did n't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all .  now do you know anything about that ? 
look at the collar on that coat .  .  . 
cinnamon roll ?  no good guess though .  no hugo that looks like jizz .  .  .   and i 'm no forensic expert mind you but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelvethousand dollar calf 's skin jacket .  the twist ?  it 's my twelve thousand dollar calf 's skin jacket .   so y 'got semen human ejaculate    that 's been allowed to soak in for what six seven hours now ?  work it 's way into the fabricfuck 'n fibers  and while you may never see it in a tide commercial i think it still safely qualifies as a tough deep down stain . 
 .  .  . to what ?  incinerate ?  cuz i 'm almost dead certain there 's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory !  some shit suffice it to say just do n't wash out .   now the money question .  .  .  to whom does that stain belong ? 
i was kinda hoping yeah . 
do you want me to say i 'm sorry ? 
only if you really truly mean it . 
are you a fucking colossal idiot ? 
i am .  yeah . 
without peer ? 
i  uh yeah i guess yeah . 
that 's right !  right now ! 
we 're hot and they 're losing a whole floor 's worth of business saying it 's under construction . 
alright bag it i 'm not shelling out that kinda bread for this shithole this is a junior suite in vegas .  call mecklen right now he should have his cell on i need an update .   get the russian up here have him clean this place floor to ceiling and get us packed .    .  .  . and send out for some new skeeze the sun's up these ones are starting to stink .  .  . 
 .  .  . see this is one 'a them rare moments when y 'ass get a chance to be completely honest .  .  .  and if i 'm asking you what you said to mecklen assume the shit is rhetorical .  .  .  so assume i already know . 
that 's mecklen .  the deal 's closing .  i can pick that phone up and i can work this out .   you 'll walk with me . 
why ? 
i do n't know .   i ca n't be alone . 
i 'll be right back . 
to calm your anxiety . 
to calm my anxiety . 
yes . 
i want you inside me right now . 
book ? 
poem .   dylan thomas .   i thought of it when i saw you on the train . 
my thomas is a little rusty . 
you did n't look very happy . 
i was n't . 
and tonight ? 
better . 
stop it . 
you behave as though you want to fuck her . 
rheya .   not here . 
and i just want to know if i 'm crazy or not  if what i think is happening is actually happening .   or am i one of those people those women who are blind to what 's going on ?   who pretend not to see their husband 's attention toward another woman ? 
let 's go home . 
you go home . 
i am .   please come with me .   i do n't want to do this here . 
you talk like an actor . 
i know i know .   but still somehow i do n't feel better . 
all right .   how about i feel better when you take them ? 
what do you mean ? 
do you remember beethoven ?   the beatles ?   movies books restaurants friends ? 
yes .   but not until you mentioned them .   as soon as you said those things i remembered them .   and they have associations that make me think of other things i remember .   it 's like filling up . 
not exactly .   it exists in a continuum that was n't proven until ten years ago a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the universe .  an infinite number of them in fact .  it was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the universe space or spacetime .   it was completely counterintuitive .   we had to unlearn everything . 
is it intelligent ? 
intelligent beyond our comprehension . 
then it 's god right ? 
it 's something . 
you still do n't believe in god ? 
the whole idea of god was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called man .   even the limits we put on it are human limits .   it can do this it can do that !   it designs it creates ! 
even a god that was n't active that just created something and stood back and watched ? 
you 're talking about a man in a white beard again .   you 're ascribing human characteristics to something that is n't human .   human beings look for causes and patterns .   how could we know what solaris is up to if anything ? 
yeah . 
i 've been doing a lot of thinking . 
i know . 
i know . 
 .  .  .  do n't explain . 
long enough . 
for .  .  .  ? 
to .  .  .  forget about you . 
yeah .  .  . 
it 's venza .   he wants you .   you for ellie and tommy . 
mike .  .  .  ? 
yeah .   it 's all over . 
so . 
i do n't know .  .  . 
you do n't have to now . 
i think it 's probably still a good idea . 
come on laughter 's the best medicine ! 
they 'll never take me alive . 
a little bunny i saved from dissection . 
harry ! 
harry
harry osborne diminishes the stature of the university . 
let me guess .   the hunting dogs .  you lost your scholarship . 
i know .   i 've got one too . 
screw scholarships !    universities are death !   they make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas !   burn em down i say ! 
why home ?  the real world beckons man !   the possibilities are endless .   want to go up to the world trade center and laugh at new jersey ? 
do n't be pitiful . 
i am not pitiful !   i am the bridge to the bermensch ! 
mmhmm . 
and you let me go on about rosomoff working me too hard ?   i feel like a complete idiot . 
you 're not half the idiot i am harry . 
listen i do appreciate your concern but
i got you a present . 
well i 've missed a lot of classes myself .  .  . 
oh .  well hang in there amigo . 
bonkers . 
loonytunes .   and yet .  .  . 
just drop me off here . 
no but i 've got this secret identity to worry about .  i 'll swing the rest of the way . 
i see .   well octavius wo n't get much further .  they 'll catch him and .  .  .  put him away .   sad .   he might very well have the truth . 
phooey on that . 
i 'm not so happy myself . 
sure in the war .   pull those cables
no no !   not there ! 
i would n't talk about things like that . 
they never caught on . 
they may .  that 's why i would keep my mouth shut . 
plenty . 
you must have shot off your mouth all the way from frankfurt to here . 
we did not . 
is you all good nazis ? 
jawohl . 
is you all little adolfs ? 
jawohl ! 
then we shall all zalute feldwebel von und zu schulz !  about face ! 
i do n't have to think .  we did n't tell anything to anybody .  not a word .  not until we hit this barrack . 
i 'll open mine too . 
let me alone . 
you 're crying animal . 
it 's that song harry ! 
you do n't want to cry over a dame that does n't even know you 're alive !  snap out of it ! 
there 's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone !  so go away ! 
why sure ! 
hey animal !  animal ! 
i 've been crazy about you for years .  i 've seen every picture you 've ever made six times .  i 'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag . 
animal !  animal !  wake up ! 
this is me animal !  it 's harry shapiro ! 
you want to go ? 
no .  i want to draw . 
yes sergeant hoffman ? 
as the duly elected compound chief i protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud . 
anything else ? 
yes .  according to the geneva convention dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial . 
of course .  i 'm aware of the geneva convention .  they will be given the burial they deserve .  or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twentyone cannons from the eastern front and give them a twentyone gun salute ? 
yes sir . 
you have a lieutenant here .  .  . 
yes sir . 
curtains would do wonders for this barrack .   you will not get them . 
wait .  the bozemanwhy did it change course ? 
the destruction of the amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector .  any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction . 
can you project its course ? 
i believe so . 
i believe so . 
yes sir .  there are two in the veridian system . 
it should be noted sir that the collapse of the veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at amargosa . 
and destroy every planet in the system . 
veridian iii is uninhabited but veridian iv supports a preindustrial humanoid society . 
population ? 
approximately two hundred thirty million . 
commander . 
sorry sir .   there is too much interference in the planet 's ionosphere for an accurate reading . 
i have to find a way to get to soran . 
no but i 'd stay out of sickbay for a while if i were you .  i still do n't know why you dropped her in the water . 
i was attempting to get in the spirit of things .  i thought it would be humorous . 
plasma coils .  .  . is there any way we can use that to our advantage ? 
i do not see how .  the plasma coil is part of their cloaking device . 
right .  and they 'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds .   datalock onto that plasma coil . 
aye sir . 
we 're only going to get one shot at this .  target their primary reactor .  with any luck their warp core should implode . 
all automates ready and functioning .  automatic moorings retracted .  all speeds available through transwarp drive . 
incredible machine .  helmsman onequarter impulse power . 
and we are gaining .  .  .  stand by tractor beam ! 
tractor beam aye ! 
if he tries to get away with warp drive he 's really in for a shock .  .  . 
execute ! 
he has been here for some time .  i can feel his presence . 
do n't give me your klingon mumbo jumbo  there ai n't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant . 
put me on the hailing frequency . 
sure  whatever games you wanna play . 
soon captain .  .  .  quite soon .   
an energy reading from c deck  from inside mr .  spock 's quarters .  .  . 
mr .  chekov i ordered spock 's quarters sealed ! 
yes sir i sealed the room myself .  nevertheless  i am reading a life form there . 
i ca n't get an answer .  starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference .  no one has time for those who only stand .  .  .  and wait . 
report status ! 
torpedoes coming in   ! 
who is this ?  !  how dare you 
who i am is not important .  that i have them is .   i will let you speak to them . 
admiral your young friend is mistaken .  i meant what i said .  and now to show my intentions are sincere .  .  .  i am going to kill one of the prisoners . 
wait !  give me a chance 

all right damn you !  all right !   give me a minute to inform my crew . 
no tricks kirk .  you have one minute . 
no tricks .  i 'm looking forward to meeting you .  kirk out . 
you should take the vulcan too . 
no . 
but why ? 
because you wish it .   
beam the vulcan up  and we talk . 
give me what i want  and i 'll consider it .  .  . 
you fool  look around you !  this planet is destroying itself ! 
yes .  exhilarating is n't it ! 
if we do n't help each other we 'll all die here ! 
perfect !  that 's the way it shall be !  .  .  .  ugive me genesisu ! 

do n't be a fool  give me your hand ! 
i will speak with you alone kirk . 
it 's not much different from enterprise .   when i was a guest aboard her some years ago captain kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals .  and now mr .  chekov let us review you say you have no details of project genesis'  ? 
let them eat static . 
they 're still running with shields down . 
of course .  we 're one big happy fleet .  ah kirk my old friend do you know the klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold ?   it is very cold in space . 
locking phasers on target . 
raise them 
uwhere 's the overrideu ?  ? 
we ca n't fire sir they 've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive .  we must withdraw ! 
no ! 
sir we must !   we must repair the damage .  enterprise will wait she 's not going anywhere . 
warp drive still inoperative .  all other systems should be restored shortly . 
visual 
rake her . 
ufull power damn youu ! 
as your teacher mr .  spock is fond of saying i like to think there always are possibilities . 
the ukobayashi maruu sir . 
on the test sir will you tell me what you did ?  i 'd really like to know . 
i reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship . 
uwhatu ? 
i changed the conditions of the test .  i received a commendation for original thinking .   i do n't like to lose . 
then  you never faced that situation  faced death .  .  . 
come come lieutenant you of all people go by the book .  hello spock .  you remember dr .  marcus .  .  . 
' .  .  .  no uncoded messages on an open channel .  .  . '
they just do n't want us going in there . 
at what . 
all stop sir . 
descend ten thousand meters .  stand by photon torpedoes . 
power levels quite low sir . 
mr .  scott can you get the mains back on line ? 
i was not . 
you 're not one of those guys from the military are you ?  trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes or some dipshit stuff like that ? 
is there something wrong with the one i have ? 
to put it mildly .  since the dawn of time men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point .  a hundred years ago using handthrown harpoons they did plenty of damage  but that was nothing compared to what they 've achieved in this century . 
it 's perfect spock a male a female together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky .  .  . 
why 's that ? 
well for one thing we simply do n't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day ! 
how soon ? 
soon .  .  .  it 's too bad because they 're very friendly as you can see .  i 've grown quite attached to them .  .  .  this way . 
i assure you that wo n't be necessary .  we were only trying to help .  .  . 
the hell you were buster .  your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales .  .  . 
came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies huh ? 
there 's really very little point in my trying to explain . 
i buy that .  what about him ? 
he 's harmless .   back in the sixties he was part of the free speech movement at berkeley .  i think he did too much lds . 
lds ?  ?  are you dyslexic on top of everything else ?  come on lemme give you a lift .  i have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases  that 's why i work with whales . 
we do n't want to be any trouble . 
you 've already been that .  c 'mon . 
do n't mention it .  and do n't try anything either .  i got a tire iron right where i can get at it . 
uh huh .  what about you ?  where you from ? 
iowa . 
a landlubber .  come on what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there ?  was it some kinda macho thing ?  if that 's all i 'm gonna be real disappointed .  i hate that macho type . 
can i ask uyouu something ? 
go ahead . 
what 's going to happen when you release the whales ? 
mr .  scott do n't make jokes we are in danger of 
full power sir . 
mr .  sulu if you please . 
the beasties seem happy to see you doctor .  i hope you like our little aquarium . 
on my way .  .  .  ! 
no power to the bay doors . 
the explosive override   ? 
it 's under water !  there 's no way to reach it .  .  . 
go on ahead .  .  .  close the hatch ! 
admiral you 'll be trapped ! 
scotty do n't prejudge .  a ship is a ship . 
thank you lt .  saavik . 
and .  .  .  here is a deposition i have made .  if it is not sufficient i will return to earth to testify . 
do n't concern yourself saavik .  your leave has been granted for good and proper cause .   how are you feeling ? 
i am well admiral . 
you will be in good hands here . 
yes admiral .   sir .  i have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son .   david died most bravely .  he saved spock .  he saved us all .  .  .  i thought you should know . 
klingon justice is a unique point of view mr .  president . 
vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the federation ! 
your vessel did destroy u . s . s .  grissom .  your men did kill kirk 's son .  do you deny these events ? 
we deny nothing !  we have the right to preserve our race ! 
do you have the right to murder ? 
millions ? 
do you know how they were damaged ? 
by a son'a weapon .   there 's no doubt about it sir .  that 's what made data malfunction . 
the son'a reports claim they did n't fire until after he malfunctioned . 
i do n't believe it happened that way . 
why would they fire at him without provocation ? 
all i know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot .  then his failsafe system was activated .  .  . 
failsafe ? 
his ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions .  .  . 
so you 're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong . 
in a sense that 's all he knew .  the system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss . 
and yet he attacked us .  and told the ba 'ku we were a threat .  .  . 
it 's nothing .  i 'm just tired . 
 .  .  .  had regenerated . 
it may not last after we leave .  if not i just wanted before we go .  .  .   i 've never actually seen a sunrise . 
i think it 's the universal greeting when you do n't like someone . 
the manifold ca n't handle full impulse in the patch commander . 
if we do n't outrun them the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship . 
i 'll be in engineering . 
you got me commander . 
that 's your expert opinion ? 
detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade .  .  .  but then again it might not .  subspace weapons are unpredictable .  that 's why they were banned . 
options ? 
eject the core . 
negative .  i want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can .  .  . 
the purpose being .  .  .  ? 
if it works you mean . 
even if it does n't they 'll be teaching kids as the academy not to do this for years to come . 
why not ? 
and i need to control this ship .  let me into your mind . 
vulcan ? 
no . 
the problem must lie in the interface between starfleet and borg technology .  your console may not be configured to handle the data flow . 
can you configure it ? 
i believe so . 
do it . 
bring us about .  target borg ship alpha four port side battery . 
ready quantum torpedo . 
go to impulse .  where 's the borg ship ? 
it has entered earth orbit .   correction  it is not in orbit .  it is heading directly toward the surface . 
what ? 
where 's the sphere ? 
contact starfleet command . 
according to our astrometric readings .  .  .  the year is 2063 . 
today is march second 2063 .  the time in montana is oheightforty five . 
just a little queasy .  .  . 
try not to look at the stars .  .  .  keep your eyes on the ship . 
right . 
and commander whatever you do .  .  .  do unotu vomit in your exosuit .  it would be .  .  .  unpleasant . 
i 'll keep that in mind . 
understood ! 
we 've lost bridge control ! 
emergency override ! 
nothing . 
we just lost main power .  .  .  and we 've got classthree alerts all over the ship .  i 'm not sure what 's 
the borg .   some of them must 've beamed over before we destroyed their ship .   seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields . 
wil .  .  .  data was down there . 
mister worf .  .  .  find data if you can but your top priority is isolating the borg . 
do we have any idea how many borg we 're dealing with ? 
where the hell are they going ? 
deflector dish .  .  .  why the deflector dish .  .  .  ? 
what are you suggesting ? 
i think mister worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll .  .  . 
hold that thought . 
we must do this again soon . 
give a girl a chance captain . 
good enough for one  two would look suspicious .  .  .  killed while attempting escape .  .  .  now that 's convincing for both . 
they 'll be here .  .  . 
i like it here .  .  . 
kill him !  he 's the one !  ! 
not me idiot  him ! 
he 's got it . 
and your coat . 
fraid not .  it would n't fit him anyway . 
krandog aranty . 
there 's a reward for your death . 
we did n't kill gorkon . 
of course not .  anyway somebody up there wants you out of the way . 
do n't you know ?  everyone on rura penthe is here for life . 
but you did n't join a conspiracy . 
i was taken from my homeworld by people called the pakjeds .  they are fat .  they traded me to a ship belonging to the bolians .  the bolians are blue .  they put me in a seat and asked me questions .  then they were attacked by another ship .  .  . 
yes please continue . 
i was in space for a long time .  then a ship belonging to the talosians picked me up .  they asked me where i came from .  i told them people called the pakleds took me from my homeworld .  they are fat
you are me . 
no .  my name is data .  .  .  i am your brother . 
i am in a room with lights . 
no . 
no . 
is that your final answer ? 
no i have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines . 
why ? 
because you are dangerous . 
why ? 
you have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship . 
i do not understand . 
i know . 
no . 
do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship ? 
no .  can i move now ? 
no .  i must deactivate you . 
for how long ? 
indefinitely . 
how long is that ? 
it 'll serve you right . 
what are you doing to counsellor troi ? 
i 'm preparing her for shinzon .  to sooth him as she soothes you .  to stand at his side as she does at yours . 
that will never happen . 
listen to him android .  such a small and weak creature .  yet he roars so valiantly .  .  . 
there 'll be another after me .  and another after that .  you 'll find we 're a resilient species . 
i look forward to the sport .   take him . 
wont do what mister worf ? 
captain .  i think it is inappropriate for a starfleet officer to appear .  .  .   naked . 
come now a big strapping fellow like you ?  what are you afraid of ? 
what sort of signature ? 
if you do n't mind . 
not yet mister worf . 
captain ! 
tactical analysis mister worf . 
fiftytwo disruptor banks twentyseven photon torpedo bays primary and secondary phased shields . 
on screen . 
who was it ? 
aye sir
thank you . 
and do n't be shy about your english .  you speak better than a lot of people i know .   take care of yourself . 
he 's got a gun !  ! 
what the hell do you think you 're doing ? 
where did you stop last ? 
stay right there .  .  . 
what was your last stop ? 
elmo 's .  .  . 
where 's that ? 
about five miles back . 
major bell here sir .  we have to tell these people that we 're friendly .  that this whole thing was a mistake .  is anyone trying to contact the ship ? 
shermin i want you and bell to start looking for the one on the ground . 
it 's a copy of the plaque nasa sent into space on the pioneer probes . 
houston found it in the extraterrestrial 's suit . 
they must have picked it up in space . 
there 's no mistake ?  you 're absolutely sure ? 
i saw it with my own eyes .  we 've killed an extraterrestrial and .  .  . 
is there any possibility that it 's a hoax ?  could you be mistaken ? 
none .  and there 's another one in the area that 's alive .  i do n't know if it 's the only one .  i do n't know if it was left here by accident or it 's part of an inva .  .  . 
get the body out of there .  load it on the air force chopper and get it to wright patterson .  they 'll take it from there .  .  .  we did n't expect this shermin . 
neither did i . 
i 'm going to the white house right now .  i 'll try and get you everything you need . 
wait wait .  .  .  what are my orders if we find this thing ? 
what do you mean by contain ? '
we do n't think that 's necessarily bad .  at least it 's a point of contact . 
not necessarily bad !  if they knew we were here why did n't they let us know they were coming ? 
we 'll get those answers when you find the one you 're looking for . 
that 's not going to happen george unless you get us the help you promised us . 
we 've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public it 's been decided not to expand the search at this time . 
do n't let them do it this way george .  it 's too important .  we ca n't find this thing alone . 
you have to .  we 're trying to contact the ship .  if we do i 'll let you know immediately .  good luck . 
when can we expect containment ? 
well we 're in pursuit of a green mustang .  .  . 
it 's in a green mustang ? 
yes .  it 's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere . 
nothing . 
horses . 
you do n't forget anything do you ? 
no . 
do they talk ?  ! 
no they do n't talk .  .  .  we talk to them . 
i understand . 
i gave you a baby last night . 
yes they are . 
you have been very good to me jennyhaydn .   you said you wanted a baby so i gave you one . 
but .  .  . 
it will be human and it will look like this .   but when it comes it will know everything i know and everything you know .  that is something from my planet that i want your baby to have . 
i told you it 's impossible for me to have a baby . 
you will have this baby .  if you want it .  if you do n't i can stop it now . 
you do n't make money gambling .  you lose it . 
what for ? 
i want to gamble . 
i understand .   thank you . 
i know how to gamble now . 
you won ten dollars .  big deal .  if we do n't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship . 
i want to get money for you and the baby . 
i do n't need any money for the baby .  i 'll be fine . 
inflation tuition college .  children are damned expensive .  i know . 
the cook again ? 
yes . 
if i ever run into that guy i 'm going to kick his ass . 
this is very interesting .  we are born knowing our history .  we have other books .  but not a book like this . 
any words you do n't know you can find in the dictionary . 
i understand . 
it 'll give you the different countries how they came to be what they are now how america came to be the governments the languages .  .  .  everything . 
many of my people will not believe those things are possible .  on my planet there is only one government one people one language .  i will be asked a lot of questions . 
what will you say about us ? 
i will say that we can be friends . 
we can . 
shutup a second ! 
i was gonna tell ya .   hey it 's just a job .   i feel like shit about it . 
you should feel like shit . 
i figured what the hell i could take the prick 's money and make sure faith was ok at the same time .   do us both good .   right ? 
fairly twisted logic max even for you .   hey at least you got a job !   watch her for me .   stay on her . 
i 'm on her . 
yeah .   no not really . 
let 's work it . 
not now .  .  .  i do n't want to think about it
come on lenny .   you used to be good at this stuff .   play it down .  what 's the perp doing ? 
he stalks her .   he rapes her .   then he does her .  .  . 
and he records it .   thrill kill .  wants to see it again .   and again . 
he records himself raping and killing her
but at the same time he 's sending the signal to her
so she feels .  .  .  what he feels .  .  .  while he 's in her .   the thrill while he 's killing her .  .  .  is sent to her heightening her fear .  .  .  which in turn heightens the turn on for him .   i 've seen a lot max . 
so 've i .   too much . 
but this is a bad one . 
top ten . 
he makes her see her own death feeds off the reaction .  .  .  killer and victim merging .  .  .  orgasm and agony merging .   and he records it all . 
why me ? 
w 'sup max ? 
yeah .   she 's leaving with tran so i got to boogie .   real quick .  .  .  iris checked into the sheraton last night under a false name .   paid cash . 
looks like she was holding out . 
yup .   hey so i heard you dropped in on tran last night .   another slick lenny move . 
he 's in this somehow .  .  .  i do n't know how .   just stay close to faith . 
i 'm on her amigo .   no worries .  gotta jam . 
you may be a little overdressed for this party .   yo tick !   it 's lenny .   open up ! 
is he dead ? 
no .   but his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs .   they put an amplifier inline to boost the signal till it frenchfried his brain . 
all i 'm saying .  .  .  you do n't know how high up the food chain this thing goes .   i 've heard stuff . 
what stuff ? 
smoke .   rumors .   i 've heard stuff about a death squad .   a group a guys loyal to the hardline school .   guys that 've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks suspending cops right and left tying their hands .  .  .  while outa the other side a their mouths these same people 're squealing save us save us do something you fucking morons crime is totally out of control . 
yeah .   so do n't walk near me in public alright . 
thanks buddy .   see .  .  .  things were n't bad enough .   they were n't fucking bad enough ! 
see you downtown . 
yeah .   see you there . 
just lenny . 
right .   that explains it . 
are you going to make me beg ? 
cheerios and wieners .   i made it myself .   it 's good . 
well give me some then .  .  .  i 'm starving . 
aw mom ! 
sucks .   hey bobby turn that up . 
yup .   he was jeriko 's manager .   bummer tran !   lost your golden goose .   could n't happen to a nicer guy . 
but i mean is n't he faith 's new 
sssssh !   not in front of lenny .   you may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him . 
maybe he just figures lenny will appreciate what he 's created .   it 's the dark end of the street lenny .  how do you like it now ? 
take the tape to the cops . 
this seems a little sophisticated for them .   these are not subtle guys . 
there 's more to this whole thing than you think . 
fine .   do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains ?   the gangbangers 'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground .   and when the fires start the street cops 'll be capping off at anything that moves .   it 'll be all out war and you know it . 
yeah well maybe it 's time for a war ! 
you really want that on your head ? 
i .  .  . 
i 've got to take a piss . 
it 's a truck .  a refrigerated truck . 
zero abducts victims all over the country kills them keeps them refrigerated for days weeks even months then buries them hundreds thousands of miles away .  karen sumpter was buried washed up in a flood .  evans was buried .  when we get zero we 'll find boneyards all across the country . 
how are we going to find him ? 
get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years .  we 've got three disappearance cities and dates three parallel discovery cities .  get into the mainframe let it crunch this information . 
i 'm going to amarillo . 
kulok . 
agent kulok could you wipe my face ? 
sit back . 
of course he does .  now get the key get these things off me .   unhook me . 
i want to protect the boy .  i also want to protect suspect zero  from you . 
no weapon . 
turn around .  stretch your arms over the seat . 
i 'll be back . 
the little piggie speaks . 
i know .  it 's like the opposite of inbreeding .  the hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool . 
darwinism at its best . 
i 've been around here six months and i still ca n't get over it . 
it 's like every day i see a beautiful woman .  i 'm not used to that .  i 'm used to seeing a beautiful woman i do n't know once a week .  i ca n't handle it .

you 're like this big bear with claws and fangs .  .  . 
 .  .  . and big fuckin' teeth .  .  . 
 .  .  . and teeth .  .  .  and she 's like this little bunny cowering in the corner .  .  .

do n't listen to him .  you call whenever it feels right to you . 
what 'd you want me to do ?  back down ?  he called me a bitch .  we kept our rep . 
 .  .  . whatever .  things are different here .  it 's not like new york mikey .

sue ! 
i 've tried calling and writing .   i want to reach michael . 
nobody knows where he is .   we know he 's all right but that 's all . 
an accident .   no one was hurt . 
listen tom i let my cab go can i come in to call another one ? 
if i accept that letter and you told a court of law i accepted it they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts .  just wait kay he 'll contact you . 
mama no . 
sonny will come after you with everything he 's got . 
even sonny wo n't be able to call off luca brasi . 
i 'll worry about luca .   you take care of sonny and the other two kids . 
i 'll try .  .  . it 's what the don would want us to do . 
good .  .  . then you can go .  .  .   i do n't like violence .   i 'm a businessman and blood is a big expense . 
okay but just tell him this is one favor i ca n't give .   but he should try me again on anything else . 
he never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first .  understood ? 
you smooth son of a bitch let me lay it on the line for you and your boss .   johnny fontane never gets that movie .   i do n't care how many dago guinea wop greaseball goombahs come out of the woodwork ! 
i 'm germanirish . 
okay my krautmick friend johnny will never get that part because i hate that pinko punk and i 'm going to run him out of the movies .   and i 'll tell you why .   he ruined one of woltz brothers' most valuable proteges .   for five years i had this girl under training singing lessons !   acting lessons !   dancing lessons !   we spent hundreds of thousands of dollarsi was going to make her a star .   i 'll be even more frank just to show you that i 'm not a hardhearted man that it was n't all dollars and cents .   that girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass i 've ever ad and i 've had them all over the world .   then johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off .   she threw it all away to make me look ridiculous .   a man in my position cannot afford to be made to look ridiculous ! 
thanks tom . 
no .   i guess i 'll see you christmas .  everyone 's going to be out at long beach right ? 
right . 
let 's say now that we have to kill mccluskey .   we 'll clear that up through our newspaper contacts later . 
no ! 
i did n't mean with you in it . 
okay you get in .  i 'm like a prune anyway . 
he 's getting impatient .  he wants me to reassure him you 'll be home by thanksgiving . 
you 've got to get a new jacket .  really .  you must be sick of the same clothes .  i 'm sick of seeing you in them . 
i ca n't .  i ca n't keep spending your father 's money . 
i love how responsible you are .  my dad should make you chief accountant or something .  let me buy you a jacket .  there 's a great place when we get to rome batistoni . 
relax . 
it 's just there 's so much to do in a single day . 
relax .  the most important question is where to eat .  i hope freddie made a reservation . 
freddie ? 
freddie miles .  you know  he 's organizing the cortina skiing trip . 
what club ? 
freddie 's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd .  come if you want but i thought you wanted to see the forum .  .  .  ? 
i did .  and then maybe get the jacket and what have you .  .  . 
you said i could pick out a jacket and i just .  .  .  sorry . 
get undressed in your own room would you ? 
i thought you 'd missed the train . 
freddie drove me back in his car . 
is freddie here ? 
he 's downstairs . 
i was just fooling around .  do n't say anything .  sorry . 
i do n't know !  why are you asking me ?   how can it take an hour to find an ambulance ? 
i 'm prepared to take the blame . 
what are you talking about ? 
you 've been so good to me .  you 're the brother i never had .  i 'm the brother you never had . 
she came to me for help she needed money and i did n't help her .  i did n't help her .  now she 's dead and it 's my fault . 
i 'm not going to say anything  to marge or anybody the police  it 's a secret between us and i 'll keep it . 
you ca n't blame him .  you could hardly expect this to go on forever . 
i thought you might write again .  now that we 're brothers .  .  . 
i ca n't how can i in all decency ?  we 've had a good run have n't we ? 
what about venice ?  can we stick to that plan at least ? 
i do n't think so tom .  you ca n't stay on here without money .  it 's time we all moved on .  besides i 'm sick of mongi .  especially now with everything  i really want to move to the north .  i need to check out san remo next week find somewhere new to keep the boat .  but it would be great though if you came with me .  our last trip before you leave .  there 's a jazz festival  we could say goodbye in style .  what do you think ?  a last trip ? 
to mongi .  you 're cheerful tonight . 
i 'm suddenly quite happy to be going back . 
that 's good . 
i 've got plans ! 
ripley 's plans . 
esatto .  i 'm always planning . 
did i know you at princeton tom ?  i did n't did i ? 
why are you asking all of a sudden ? 
no reason .  because you 're leaving i guess .  i do n't think you were there were you ? 
why ? 
i mean it as a compliment .  you 've got such great taste i do n't know .  most of the thugs at princeton had tasted everything and had no taste .  used to say the cream of america rich and thick .  freddie 's the perfect example . 
then i 'll take it as a compliment . 
i knew it !  i had a bet with marge ! 
ha . 
do you even like jazz  or was that something for my benefit ? 
i 've gotten to like it .  i 've gotten to like everything about the way you live .  it 's one big love affair .  if you knew my life back home in new york .  .  . 
what ? 
so cool . 
i am .  i really am .  and i 've been travelling .  i just ca n't seem to get that far north . 
well hurry before we sink .   should i give you my telephone number in venice ? 
thanks . 
i ca n't later . 
and tomorrow ? 
tomorrow 's possible .  do you know dinelli 's ?  piazza di spagna ? 
i know the piazza di spagna .  what time ? 
ten thirty ? 
we 'll be there . 
okay .  marge see you tomorrow .   it 's really good to meet you . 
not at all .  morning tom . 
hi .   sorry .  you okay ?  you look as if you 've seen a ghost .  .  . 
but the point is dickie  well we know this  dickie loves marge and he misses her and apparently he 's come to his senses .  .  . 
it 's fantastic .   i feel guilty .  marge does n't understand this but anytime dickie does something i feel guilty . 
do n't be daft .  it 's fine .  i 'm delighted you finally made it to venice .  i 'm delighted contrary to rumour you 're still in one piece ? 
what rumour ? 
that dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport .  i know ridiculous . 
it 's okay . 
anyway i 've got to the bottom of the delay .  finally .  we 're waiting for someone from rome . 
what do you mean ?  they 're sending someone from rome ? 
that 's good is n't it ? 
no but i thought that did n't happen in italy that each region was completely separate !  i was sure that was the 
you 've seen the papers you know what a big deal it 's been here .  american tourist murdered 
it 's ridiculous but now you 've mentioned the stench i can hardly breathe .

il signor ripley ha una fidanzata il signor dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor freddie miles ha molte fidanzate .

lovebirds .

sure .  you can have it .   where 's your bag ?  in the car ? 
i just picked up some things for the night at the general store .  you see i had n't planned on spending much time here .

all right .  
yes . 
i do n't believe you .   i think you came up to see me . 
why would i want to see you of all people ? 
i do n't know .  but it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who i was and where i lived and .  .  . 
it was no trouble at all .  i simply called my father 's paper .  besides i was coming up here anyway i already told you .  .  . 
you like me huh ? 
i loathe you .  you have no manners .  and you 're arrogant and conceited and .  .  .  i wrote you a letter about it in fact but i tore it up . 
what did it say ? 
none of your business .   am i still bleeding ? 
i ca n't say i like your seagulls much either .  i come all the way up here to .  .  . 
but you were coming up anyway remember ? 
i was !  and all i get for my pains is a .  .  .  a .  .  .  a hole in the head ! 
right next to the one you already had . 
look mr .  brenner .  .  . 
i 'm sorry .  i could n't possibly .  .  . 
you are are n't you ? 
certainly but .  .  . 
then it 's settled .  what time is dinner mother ? 
of course how stupid of me .  a quarter to seven will that be all right ? 
annie .  .  .  annie may have made other plans .  i 'll have to see .  besides i can find my own way . 
you 're sure now ?  you wo n't hire a boat or anything ? 
i 'm sure . 
seven o 'clock then . 
maybe . 
famished . 
dinner 's just about ready .   we were out back looking at the chickens .  something seems to be wrong with them . 
he was watching a ball game on television . 
what ? 
his wife changed the channel . 
oh yes . 
will i be seeing you again ? 
san francisco 's a long way from here . 
i 'm in san francisco five days a week .  with a lot of time on my hands .  i 'd like to see you .   maybe we could go swimming or something .  mother tells me you like to swim . 
how does mother know what i like to do ? 
i guess she and i read the same gossip columns . 
oh .  that .  rome . 
mmmm .  i like to swim .  we might get along very .  .  . 
in case you 're interested i was pushed into that fountain . 
without any clothes on ? 
with all my clothes on !   the newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father 's paper .   anything they said .  .  . 
you were just a poor innocent victim of circumstance huh ? 
i 'm neither poor nor innocent but the truth of that particular .  .  . 
the truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd .  .  . 
yes but .  .  . 
 .  .  . who did n't much care for propriety or convention or .  .  . 
yes . 
 .  .  . the opinions of others and you went right along with them is n't that the truth ? 
yes that 's the truth .  but i was pushed into that fountain and that 's the truth too . 
sure .  do you really know annie hayworth ? 
no .   at least i did n't until i came up here . 
so you did n't go to school together . 
no . 
and you did n't come up here to see her . 
no . 
you were lying . 
yes i was lying . 
did you really write a letter to me ?  or was that a lie too ? 
i wrote the letter . 
what did it say ? 
it said dear mr .  brenner i think you need those lovebirds after all .  they may help your personality .  that 's what it said . 
but you tore it up . 
yes . 
why ? 
because it seemed stupid and foolish . 
like jumping into a fountain in rome ! 
i told you what happened in rome ! 
do you expect me to believe .  .  .  ? 
i do n't give a damn what you believe ! 
why ? 
i think it could be fun . 
it is for me . 
but not for me . 
what do you want  ? 
i thought you knew !  i want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked !  good night ! 
who would believe that ?   and you know someone else might recognize her .   she was as well known as the castle rock . 
wait doctor  wait !   the child 's fainting . 
pulse ? 
he has his own idea of a joke .  perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs . 
i 've just been to see mrs .  marsh .  georgina is doing splendidly .   the incision has healed  clean and fine  but she does n't seem to have any desire to walk . 
when she 's ready you bring her to me  i 'll show her how . 
dr .  macfarlane i wonder if you know what happiness you 've brought those people . 
that 's only our duty fettes  that 's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business . 
that 's the way of it fettes .   you bring the lassie to me . 
but she must want to stand .   she must want to walk . 
confound me the child 's a cripple of course she wants to walk .   child i say to you get up out of that chair and walk . 
no . 
what do you mean fettes ? 
i 'll have no more to do with it .  i 'll not put my neck into the noose not even for your sake dr .  macfarlane . 
do n't be a fool .   one ca n't begin and then stop  and because that entry of the girl 's body is in your hand you 'll do as i say .  as for me i 'll tend to gray . 
the little girl  she could n't walk far  the muscles are too weak  but she did stand and she took a step or two . 
i know it  i know it  the moment i was rid of him 
what ? 
gray  i 'm rid of him 
a burial party  poor people  it 's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely . 
glencorse  that 's a lonely cemetery fettes not a soul around for miles . 
they 'll be thinking of that too . 
tosh !   fettes !   it 's not their grief i 'm worrying about  i 'm talking of our own end 
you 've no thought of going there ? 
did you think gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel ?   i 've had some practice in the art . 
you could n't do that doctor . 
i pass up no opportunities i 've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows .   we 'll need subjects to demonstrate .  come along . 
no . 
why not ?  i must have subjects .  it 's the only way i can teach .  it 's the only way you can learn .  the stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no  nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as gray .  we can do our own dirty work  and we must . 
no room there .  we 'll have to set it between us . 
my dad was right !  he said you 'd ruin her life . 
no .  listen to me .  lauren found out something they did n't want her to know .   this . 
no !  why are you haunting me ? 
because you need to understand .  and you need .  .  .  to be careful . 
yeah i know . 
when lauren was missing the police came to our house .  they said they were looking for her right ?   but i know now they had her and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you .  .  . 
no .  .  . 
 .  .  .  is that i sent them here .  i told them she came here sometimes .  with her dirtball boyfriend .  that 's exactly what i said . 
it 's all my fault .  oh god .  i wish i were dead . 
no .  you do n't . 
yes i do i really do . 
i do n't want to see ! 
so you 're going to kill him ? 
have to find him first . 
my father . 
all i knew she was pulling away .  it made me crazy . 
i used to be so proud of him .  my big deal daddy .  and now he 's just a crook .  worse even .  and the weird thing is .  .  . 
it 's what lauren would do . 
it 's not .  i ca n't take it . 
erin .  who ? 
i do n't know .  i found him lying there . 
bobby and i have had enough excitement for tonight . 
you think it 's all right for you to stay here ? 
i 've got a good lock on my door .   and bobby 's going to sleep in my room tonight . 
i  i 'm afraid i ca n't  not right now .  can i talk to you later ?  .  yes that 'll be fine .  bye . 
come on in . 
what about him ? 
helen he 's the man from the space ship !   i had that diamond checked at three different places .  nobody on earth 's ever seen a stone like that !  after what bobby told us that 's enough for me .  why is it nobody knows anything about him ?  why has n't he got any money ? 
all right tom  it 's true .  i know it 's true . 
how do you know ? 
never mind about that .   you 've got to promise me you wo n't say a word to anybody . 
are you crazy ?  after what happened today ? 
you do n't understand .  you do n't realize how important it is . 
important ?  of course it 's important .  the point is we can do something about it . 
that 's what i 'm trying to tell you .  we must n't do anything about it .  believe me tom i know what i 'm talking about . 
he 's a menace to the whole world !  it 's our duty to turn him in . 
but he is n't a menace !  he told me what he came here for . 
he told you .  .  .  do n't be silly honey  just because you like the guy .   you realize what this 'd mean for us ?  i 'd be the biggest man in the country .  i could write my own ticket . 
is that what you 're thinking about ? 
why not ?  somebody 's got to get rid of him . 
i do n't care about the rest of the world ! 
i feel different right now . 
you wait and see .  you 're going to marry a big hero ! 
i 'm not going to marry anybody . 
i enjoyed every minute of it . 
jittery is the word . 
he has his homework to keep him occupied . 
he 's a fine boy mrs .  benson . 
naturally i think so . 
warm and friendly and intelligent  you know  he 's the only real friend i 've made since i 've been here . 
oh  they just wanted to ask me a few questions .  bobby and i tried to see professor barnhardt in the afternoon but he was n't in .  apparently they thought i was looking for secrets of some kind . 
this is michael . 
who laddie ? 
i know it was them star .   i 'm sure of it .   he was working in the yard  hammering something .   the yard was big with lots of grass .   there was no boardwalk and no ocean .   she was bringing him something cold to drink .  .  .  and had red hair .   i was there too .   and a dog  but i do n't know its name .   i was running and the dog was chasing me .  then i turned around and chased the dog .   they were watching me .  drinking their cold drinks and laughing .   and i was laughing too . 
laddie .  .  .  you can ustillu remember .  you can still remember home . 
it was a dream star . 
no laddie .   it was a umemoryu . 
no .   just you . 
promise me you 'll keep it that way .   you 're not like the others laddie .   you 're like me .   i can still remember too . 
i like michael . 
you better not like him too much . 
for what . 
for everything . 
he 's just a deep sleeper . 
he 's not breathing mom . 
bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want .  .  .  well til eleven thirty maybe . 
i 'll hitch . 
oh no you wo n't . 
i get off in another twenty minutes .   i thought maybe we 'd all get a bite together . 
i 'll pass . 
no .   i 'm up . 
michael will you do me a favor this evening ?   will you stay home with sam tonight ?   i 'm meeting max for dinner after work . 
i watch him all day .   the only time i have more myself is at night .   let grandpa watch him . 
grandpa has plans of his own .   michael i want you to do this .  everybody has been bending over backwards for you .   you come home late .   you sleep in to the middle of the day  sam is always alone .  you do exactly what you want .  .  .  tonight do what i want for a change . 
okay . 
i 've asked him to try and locate the site .   okay with you ? 
sure .   you think there 's a connection ? 
maybe . 
so what 's our problem ? 
well .  .  .  there 's still some cell activity .  .  .  it 's not entirely dead yet . 
anybody sick ? 
no i .  .  .  i do n't mean infection .  .  .  or disease .  .  . 
if the weather clears enough before we reach anybody  i 'm sending you and doc up to macmurdo .  .  . 
damn you blair !   you 've already got everybody halfhysterical around here . 
you ca n't let anybody leave ! 
i 've got six dead norwegians on my hands a burned up flying saucer and we 've just destroyed the scientific find of the century .   now fuck off ! 
finish what ? 
 .  .  .  i think the whole process would have taken an hour .  .  .  maybe more .  and then i suppose both would have changed back to dog form . 
nobody 's getting in here .   you can tell them all that ! 
well who the hell you think wants to get in there with you ? 
and i do n't want any more food with sedatives in it .   i know what you 're up to .   do n't think i do n't .   and if anyone tries to get in here  i 've got rope .   i 'll hang myself before it gets to me . 
you promise ? 
 .  .  .  you think this thing wants to become an animal ?   dogs ca n't make it 1000 miles to the sea .   no skua gulls to imitate this time of year .  .  .  no penguins this far inland .  .  .  do n't you understand ?  !   it wanted to become us ! 
look blair maybe you 're right about this .   but we 've got to be rational .  we 've got to talk this over .   i 'm unarmed and i 'm coming in . 
no you 're not !   i do n't trust any of you ! 
it 'll come .   it needs us .   we 're the only thing left to imitate .  .  .   give me a hand . 
i 'm going to blow the generator when you get back .   he 'll have to come for us  or freeze . 
just keep looking . 
could n't be possible .   must have weighted a ton and a half .  .  . 
bullshit !   he 's got to know damn well i cut it ! 
what are you going to do ?   drink it ? 
watching norris in there .  .  .  gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole .   every piece of you is selfsufficient an animal unto itself .   when a man bleeds it 's just tissue .   but blood from one of you things wo n't obey .  it 's a newly formed individual with a builtin desire to protect its own life .   when attacked your blood will try and survive  and crawl away from a hot needle say . 
everything that 's been missing . 
anyplace but here . 
forget about childs .   he 's over . 
you crazy ?   he might be inside already ? 
chance we got to take .   we got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged . 
for god 's sake david 
there are some things i need to say to you .   you may not like hearing them but i do n't know if i 'll ever get another chance 
you care for me .   and you 're concerned .   and i have to start living my life again .   i hear it from mrs .  watchit every day . 
but you wo n't listen .   you wo n't see me you wo n't see anyone .   what would you like me to tell jamie ?  that uncle alex is busy ?   that uncle alex is hiding up there in his laboratory 
hiding ? 
you know that 's what it is .   mrs .  watchit tells me you 're here at all hours  day and night 
that 's because i 'm working .   you remember that ?   you used to care about your work . 
i care more about my life .   and yours . 
i live with it every minute of every day . 
i know that 
you do n't know that .   you could n't possibly .   if i 'd only done this or that if i 'd arrived ten minutes earlier or later .   if we 'd taken a different path or i had n't fought the man for the ring .   you have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night  consider every action you made  and every one of them wrong . 
it was n't your fault alex . 
was n't it ?  .  .  .  i have a dream almost every night now .   the lady and the tiger you remember that story ?   in the dream i 'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors .  behind every door save one is a tiger .   i have to make the decision .   which door conceals emma ?   and i just stand there .  .  .  looking at the doors .  .  . 
do you find her ? 
that 's where you 're wrong .   i will change it . 
what is it ? 
you would n't believe me . 
i would . 
i 'll tell you what .  .  .  come by for dinner in a week and i 'll show you . 
why do n't you come to our house instead ? 
i ca n't do that 
when's the last time you were outside this house    or this room ? 
i ca n't leave when i 'm so close . 
there are trains leaving grand central every then minutes .   a dozen liners leaving the harbor .  get on one of them .   go to singapore scotland manchuria anywhere just away from here 
that 's absurd 
you 're dying here .   do n't you see that ?  ! 
i pray to god that in a week you 're not here . 
in a week .  .  .  we will never have had this conversation . 
good night alex . 
i 'm glad . 
his home . 
thank you .  .  . 
i hope it 's a happy journey for you both  and much as i hate to do this moved as i am by your protestations of love i 'll be needing your money now . 
sir .  .  .  ? 
and your jewelry too .   i guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss . 
i do n't understand . 
i wish they 'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget .  our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we do n't have . 
maybe it 's not such a waste . 
they do n't care about all the things we do right .  beat but they might  .  .  . they might care about what we 're doing wrong .  beat that 's what they should come here to look for . 
they should just be looking harder . 
later .  i 'll tell you about it later .  we got a session to catch now . 
i am .  one of the few things i remember doing is eating .  so i guess i must be exercising it off in my dreams . 
sure . 
good . 
beat what do you need me to do ? 
beat thank you . 
i ca n't take you out of here in your condition .  .  . 
and i ca n't stay here in my condition .  i am going to die tonight .  it 's already been decided . 
no it has n't . 
yes .  beat it has .  everything up till today is done .  everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs . 
his body was found on january 1 1993 but do you know if that was long after he had died ? 
no i do n't .  i 'm sorry .  i wish i knew more . 
what about dr .  thomas becker or dr .  loel lorenson ?  there was also a dr .  gries i think . 
well dr .  lorenson is still here at the hospital .  if she was here at the time your father was then i 'm sure she 'd be of more help to you . 
what about dr .  becker and mr .  gries ? 
unfortunately i 'm not familiar with dr .  becker and dr .  gries passed away three four years ago . 
mom he just fixed our car . 
jackie get in the car .  now ! 
beat thanks . 
i 'm not sure . 
let me ask you that again .  this time look around and consider your options . 
you do n't have anywhere to stay ? 
i do n't think so . 
i 'm not sure .  beat i do n't really know . 
of course you do n't know . 
why of course ? 
because in my life it would n't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he 's from and a place where he 's going to .  it 'd be too simple .  i probably would n't know how to handle a situation like that . 
well you definitely did n't pick normal or simple this time either . 
beat i was dropped off . 
do you have a motel or something ?  money ? 
well do n't you somewhere ?  stuff ?  belongings ? 
no .  beat not around here . 
nothing .  getting up thanks for bringing me this far . 
where are you going ?  you 'll freeze out there .  you do n't even have a coat . 
i 'll manage . 
no you wo n't .  you 'll die of cold out there and then i 'll have to feel guilty .  and i 've already got more guilt than i know what to do with .  beat do you want something to drink ? 
no i 'm ok . 
you know what ?  it 's christmas eve .  and you look clean  i mean you 're normallooking .  resolutely for her own benefit it 's christmas eve and i have a couch . 
the best i could do with what was in your fridge . 
no it 's fine .  beat swallow thanks . 
ca n't you tell when somebody 's hittin' on you ? 
so what if he was ?   it 's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded that 's all . 
maybe . 
well just relax will ya .   you 're makin' me nervous . 
givin' him a taste of his own medicine .   asshole . 
i 'm sorry louise .   i know you 're all upset .   it 's just i 'm so excited to be out of the house i guess .   i wonder if darryl 's home yet . 
i wonder if jimmy 's gotten back . 
why do n't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all ? 
why do n't you ditch that loser husband of yours ? 
in the meantime you said we were gonna have some fun .   so let 's have some ! 
ready when you are . 
get the car . 
jesus christ !   louise you shot him .

i do n't know .   just tell em what happened . 
which part ? 
all of it .   that he tried to rape me . 
only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night thelma !   who 's gonna believe that ?  !   we just do n't live in that kind of world .   pull over ! 
yes . 
it means you do n't talk to anybody .  you do n't draw attention to yourself in any way .   do you understand that ? 
our next move ?   i 'll say one thing louise .   this is some vacation .   i sure am having a good time .   this is real fun . 
if you were n't so concerned with having a good time we would n't be here right now . 
just what is that supposed to mean ? 
it means shut up thelma . 
so this is all my fault is it . 
so you admit it ? 
guilty as charged .  i 'm not gonna play games with you .  i could give you a song and dance but what 's the point ?  i did it and we all know it .   the hitcher himself told me it 's illegal .  the irony .  .  . 
jeez i did n't catch it . 
hitchhikers ?  i do n't know  fifty .  .  .  a hundred maybe  who keeps track ? 
i guess . 
you sent that ? 
uhhuh .  i was worried about you . 
well .  .  .  thank you .  but .  .  .  you know you 're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me . 
that 's what i want to tell ya .  i 've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what ?  you were right  i needed help . 
that 's great woogie i 'm happy you 're better  you seem .  .  .  good but .  .  .  you put me through quite an ordeal you know . 
woogie i caught you redhanded . 
all right i did but i was in a weird place then . 
oh mary honey you 're taking this all wrong .   i 'm not leaving .  .  . 
 .  .  . not until i get a little something to remember you by . 
stop that !  no !  somebody help me !  !  !  !  ! 
just one pair !  you owe me that much you heartless bitch ! 
he implied it . 
well you 're a writer and a lot of writers are gay .  look at truman capote . 
yeah but he was successful . 
let me ask you this when you smoke a cigar do you ever pretend it has balls ? 
i 'm going to fix you up with my new assistant . 
what 's he like ? 
so she 's married ? 
nope .  never been . 
huh ? 
four kids three different guys . 
three different guys ? 
well i 'm guessing .  there 's a black kid two whites and a midget . 
oh my . 
hyperactive little fuckers too .  tough to keep up with in a wheelchair i bet . 
she 's in a wheelchair ?  ! 
it 's just that .  .  .  mary .  i would n't have thought .  .  . 
anyway the good news is i have all the information you need .  got it from her bookie  nice guy .  you should definitely call her ted .  i mean she 's a real sparkplug that one .  she seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help i 'll bet she does it . 
ted ?  do n't you want the name of the housing project ? 
uh that 's okay . 
you sure big guy ?  i 'll bet she 'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy ! 
oh uh i resigned . 
yeah this insurance business is too slow for me .  i 'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai . 
jai alai ? 
yeah i do n't know why but i always felt at home in the fronton . 
good good . 
well i think you 're right i should look her up . 
rollerpig ?  are you nuts ? 
but you said she was a sparkplug .  .  .  ? 
i said buttplug .  she 's heinous . 
it 's a goddamn bunion .  it 'll heal . 
oh .  i thought  that 's not it anyway .  i know this does n't make any sense to you but i just ca n't turn it off that fast .  i still feel something for her . 
japan ?  what 's she doing in japan ? 
you 've heard of mailorder brides ?  well they go that way too . 
fetched a pretty penny too .  do n't forget it 's the sumo culture they pay by the pound there .  sort of like tuna . 
surprised ? 
all right let 's go . 
yeah sure . 
toy poodle ! 
wait hold on mary  it 's not as bad as it sounds .  i certainly did n't know 
that you put a murderer on my trail ? 
well yeah i did n't know much about him .  i just thought 
what did you think ted ?  that you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone i could .  .  .  really go for ? 
then what the fuck did you do it for ? 
i did it because because i 'd never stopped thinking about you and if i did n't find you i knew my life would never be good again . 
mary come on .  .  . 
go ! 
okay . 
you 're woogie ? 
you forgot your keys ! 
i .  .  .  i just want you to be happy mary . 
but i think i 'd be happiest .  .  .  with you . 
oh yeah that 'd make golf real fun  the guy does n't even drink beer or gamble . 
dean rusk ! 
wrong and you get to wax my car . 
yeah . 
i uh .  .  . 
what about you ?  where are you going ? 
back to work . 
no you were n't . 
i was you bastard . 
today for your information is pulaski day .  we 're going to buffalo .  .  . 
not as far as the election goes . 
good . 
there 've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them . 
then we need to do a few things right away .  no pierre .  he knows the press knows .  you 're going to have to keep up your schedule  your movements are followed too closely .  and we need to get these guys out of the white house .  george ball 's got a conference room at state .   reconvene over there this afternoon come back here tonight . 
no way cooch . 
let the press through . 
after we 've completed our investigation . 
watch out ! 
you 're steppin' on sign . 
 leo was n't killed here .  he was dumped here .  out of a vehicle .  bald tread .  muffler held on with baling wire . 
bullshit . 
 well maybe twoseventeen . 
you 're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track ? 
no .  not just a track .  you gotta listen to the trees man .  to the leaves .  to this sand you fbi 's kicked all up .  you gotta listen to the earth . 
is that right ?  well listen to this drag your ass .  this is a restricted area . 
no this is the home of the oglala sioux and i want the dogfucker who killed leo .  whether you get him or i get him i just want him .  shit 's been goin' on too long . 
you 've got no jurisdiction . 
you got no knowhow .  about indian way .  or about jack shit for that matter . 
maybe you 're not aware of this crow horse but i just flew in from a place called the twentieth century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods psycholingusitics dna fingerprinting i do n't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers .  leo was killed right here . 
go back to the m . e .  take a look inside leo 's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there .  trust me there ai n't chickens in the badlands .  his mother 's place is 
 his mother never lived here .  she was from up in north dakota . 
i 'm talkin' his spiritual mother .  maisy blue legs . 
his spiritual mother .  .  . 
to us indians our spiritual relatives are as close as family .  i 've got seven mothers on this reservation .  sisters .  brothers .  you ai n't one of them . 
thank god .  now listen to me asshole .  i 'm giving you a break .  but if my partner finds out you 're here you 're gonna be reading rat tracks in sioux falls maximum security . 
easy .  easy .  .  .  i 'm goin' . 
is that right ?  what are the trees saying today ? 
they 're sayin' that nobody 's gonna talk to you cuz they do n't give away one of their own .  but they did say there 's somebody way across the little walking river who wants to talk to you . 
let 's go . 
medicine .  as in medicine man ? 
they know the rules .  .  .  that 's the deal .  that 's why you 're up there .  it 's him or me .  that 's the price of admission .   it bothers you why ?  you 're part of it .    everybody dies .  most people do n't get to die for something . 
you do n't believe any of this .  you do n't think you 'll ever die . 
that 's it of course .  when i 'm up there and doing it i 'm cheating it every second .  i 'm subverting all laws .  .  . gravity .  .  . whatever .  i 'm skating the edge of it . 
winston churchill . 
all you 've got is one life .  i guess it 's worth about the same to every body .  you ever see an old woman after her husband has died ?  and the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead .  .  .   when you 're in the air and doing something really dangerous you can look ahead .  .  .  maybe ten seconds .  that 's your whole future .  that 's as far as it goes .  but imagine what those seconds are worth . 
what if you kill yourself ?  think of everything you 'll miss .  maverick there is lots of stuff i do n't know about .  .  .   fine wine .  .  .  great art .  .  .  the opera .  i guess if i live long enough i 'll get to it .  if i do n't i 'll never miss it . 
are you really that brave ? 
i watched my mother die .  cancer .  she had a long time to think about it .  they say you reach an agreement with death .  come to accept the fact that pretty soon you wo n't be here .  i did n't see that .  she .  .  .  was very brave .  .  . braver than i am .  you go up there there is n't time to think .  if you make a mistake you 're just a smudge on the ground .  simplifies funeral arrangements . 
it 's just as i thought . 
what ? 
thanks very much .   care for some suchi ?  . 
where ? 
you want to go ballistic ? 
i do n't know .  i do n't like being out of control . 
and now ? 
and now i want you . 
you always get what you want ? 
i do n't know yet . 
anything . 
no fooling on base no signs no comments no talk .  by anyone . 
why ? 
i 'm a professional .  you guys are in my line of work . 
in that order ? 
well no .  .  . inverse order . 
i 'm still second best . 
you ever fly an f14 ?  
i do n't fly in anything that does n't show movies . 
 .  yeah ! 
does n't it ever bother you ? 
why what 's gonna happen ? 
what do you take me for ?  it 's a navy cross . 
just good luck . 
where 'd you get it . 
pawn shop .  what 's to eat ? 
well you 'll just have to make do with him  . 
he 's a hell of a flyer .  in fact he 's so damn good he might have been picked for top gun himself .  except for one thing .   he just ca n't seem to follow orders ! 
it 's not the plaque .  the winner can get assigned here as instructor .  he gets to fight every day . 
thirty seconds .  that 's all it took to blow us out of the sky . 
that 's because you do n't have any women . 
until last night .  did you see the moves i was making on that girl at the party ? 
the girl with the purple fingernails ? 
that 's hertall hungry woman with fire in her eyes .  it was great . 
i did n't ruin her .

oh i get it i 'm dreaming !   and this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me . 
not exactly .   what you 're experiencing is a freeform delusion based on our memory tapes .   but you 're inventing it yourself as you go along . 
well if this is my delusion who invited you ? 
i 've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure .   i 'm sorry to tell you this mr .  quaid but you 've suffered a schizoid embolism .  we ca n't snap you out of your fantasy .  i 've been sent in to try to talk you down . 
how much is cohaagen paying you for this ? 
think about it .   your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure .  everything after thatthe chases the trip to mars your suite here at the hiltonthese are all elements of your rekall holiday .   and ego trip you paid to be a secret agent . 
bullshit .   it 's all coincidence . 
what about the girl ?   brunette athletic sleazy and demure just like you specified .   is that a coincidence ? 
she 's real .   i dreamed about her before i even went to rekall . 
mr .  quaid can you hear yourself ?  she 's real because you dreamed her ? 
that 's right . 
no need to be rude .   i 'll do it . 
swallow this . 
it 's a symbol .   of your desire to return to reality .  inside your dream you 'll fall asleep . 
any news of quaid ? 
not since you lost him . 
watch your mouth captain . 
where ?

she likes ubothu of us .   we both helped her out . 
you are so full of shit .  .  . 
oh yeah ?   think about this  she ai n't as narrowminded as you .  i 'll lay odds she 's looking for character in a man .   for my part i 'd be proud to have her .   i 'd goddamn worship her . 
she wants to lay down .   i 'm a little worried . 
damn fred you ca n't give away all those . 
forget it .   i got vegetables coming out my ears .   usually the varmints eat up half my crop but lately i ai n't so much as useenu a gopher or a jackrabbit nowheres .

dowd also reports that his team of private investigators .  .  .  ? 
i embroidered .

i lied . 
but i like that theory .  and since i 'm not putting twerp professor on the stand and since i do n't have a better theory i 'm sticking with that theory .  meantime i want pictures of the joes .  what 'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like shu to fool the eyewitnesses ! 
have you considered that chuckie roeder 's not calling himself chuckie roeder these days ?  get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who 've got hotpants for you .  .  .  then canvass those art supplies places .  we 're gonna win this one kitty but ya gotta believe .  .  . 
maybe i just live here what do you think about that ?

yes .   we 've all got to let go .

i do n't have a goddamned idea . 
i have to talk to you . 
call the a . m . a .    .  .  . i ca n't talk now .    .  .  . tell them you 're dr .  somebody .  .  .  you have to find this nurse .  .  . 
mr .  alito please . 
business hours are over sir .  this is the switch .  .  . 
i have to reach him .  this is an emergency .  could you give me his home number ? 
i 'm sorry sir we 're not allowed .  .  . 
 .  .  . would you would you call him up .  i 'll give you my number and ask him .  .  . 
i ca n't guarantee that .  .  . 
i understand .  thank you my name is galvin .  i 'll be at the following number in a half an hour .  it 's urgent . 
it 's always been a good persuader . 
could n't you try to communicate with them first  and shoot later if you have to ? 
i 'm here to make up a report not to interfere with the operations you 've set up .   you 're still in command .   clayton forrester !   i have n't seen you since oak ridge . 
not all .   radio is out .   but our field phones are okay so far . 
and they 'll go out the minute there 's another ray .   a cylinder reported down by huntington beach .   that 's a job for the navy . 
from the data  and from that picture the air force took earlier tonight  .  .  .    .  .  .  what we 've got in the gully out there is a guide ship .   one lands  .  .  .  others follow later .   they appear to clear an area then drop in groups of threes joined magnetically .   is that possible ? 
that 's because we want a chance to observe them .   this is the only place we 've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them .   what happens here will be a guide to all other operations .  the minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops i 'll get my report to washington .   you 've deployed your forces well . 
thank you sir .   if they start anything we can blast them right off the earth ! 
they 'll probably move at dawn . 
it was nearer than that . 
welll .  .  . how do you do dr .  forrester ! 
there 's a square dance at the social hall this evening . 
but they 're not human !   dr .  forrester says they 're some kind of an advanced civilization 
if they 're more advanced than us they should be nearer the creator for that reason ! 
i 've done about all i can do here .  you go back in .   sylvia  i like that doctor forrester .   he 's a good man . 
interestingly enough in the dreams there is one person .   a gatekeeper so to speak .   someone freddy 's got to get by before he can enter our world .   it 's you heather . 
me ?   why me ? 
dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense .   you played nancy after all the first to humiliate and defeat him . 
that was nancy not me ! 
but it was you that gave nancy her strength .   so to get out he has to come through you .   and it 's inevitable that he 'll hit you at your most vulnerable points .  .  . 
heather it 's just a movie a dream really .  .  . 
you know damn well it 's more than that now !   how can we stop him ? 
choice ?   what kind of choice ? 
whether or not you 're willing to play nancy one last time . 
now that you have a child is it possible you 've decided horror is bad for children ? 
no not really .   i .  .  . 
do you let your child watch your movies ? 
my child ?   no .  .  . but .  .  . 
and how about your costar in nightmare i .   would you trust him alone with your child ? 
robert ?   i .  .  . 
maybe we should ask him hmmm ?   we 've got a surprised heather .   a great big surprise for you and our audience . 
heather this is sara risher over at new line .   how are you ? 
oh hi .   i 'm fine sara .   my god a voice from the past ! 
really !   listen heather i wo n't take but a minute of your time .   it 's just that we have something to propose to you and wonder if you 'd stop by the offices .  bob 'd love to talk to you . 
uh .  .  . sure .  .  . when ? 
no time like the present .   the car will bring you . 
now ? 
just take a minute .   you 'll be glad you did i bet . 
coffee 'd be nice . 
sounds good .   kim would you get heather and me a coffee ?   how you like it hon ? 
black 's fine . 
me too . 
not yet . 
it 's time these boys saw some real blue water . 
yep . 
i thought we 'd have a better chance if i headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails . 
twice . 
is that what you were trained to do ? 
no . 
then what do you think he was trying to do . 
let the blow drive the boat down wind .   neutralize our canvas . 
no . 
oh on the contrary the albatross is considered a very good omen .   it is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on .   it 's very bad luck if you kill one .   and dolphins too . 
i know . 
as you can see there 's a lot to do . 
indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind . 
this is a working ship .   promptness is not a luxury it 's a necessity as is the work to maintain her .   had we been ready i can assure you we would have sailed . 
happily it all worked out .  .  .  this time .   bill take philip below and help him find a bunk . 
it will be more than that i can promise you . 
take good care of my son . 
he 's a big boy . 
and of course we are . 
well you never can tell these days can you ? 
forty bucks .  .  . 
this is easy money pardner .  .  .  no ones gonna get hurt in this thing .  .  .  and i do n't think you can afford not to take it .  .  .  i 'll be bringin' the eldo round the front of the motel at ten tomorrow mornin' .  .  .  if you ai n't a pussy  you 'll be there . 
hey .  .  .  i never said you was a pussy .  .  .  always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind 'a thing .  .  .  sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good . 
yeah .  .  .  yeah .  .  .  i guess so .  .  .  that kind 'a money 'd get us a long way down that yellow brick road .  .  . 
like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby .  .  . 
she 's my girl .  .  .  she 's drivin' .  .  .  that bother you ? 
why should it ? 
that 's right .  .  .  take one of these . 
what is it ? 
panty hose .  work better 'n stockin's .  pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head .  you get the pistol .   remember soon as we get inside you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it .  once they notice the ithaca and the smith they 'll know we ai n't foolin' with em . 
told ya i would .  you still riled ? 
you still screwing sixteenyearolds in the ass ? 
wish i 'd fuckin' cut you up good .

no shit ?  !  ?  !  you know him ? 
used to . 
what 'd you say ? 
no of course . 
what 's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow ? 
maybe he 'll get a little nervous but who gives a shit ? 
got enough thanks .  we 're lookin' for a place has some music where we can maybe do some dancin'  get somethin' to eat too .  anything like that around here ? 
what 's the name of it ? 
club zanzibar . 
you say it 's straight ahead a mile ? 
about .  where lafitte crosses over galvez highway .  state road 86 . 
thanks . 
well i ai n't upset about it darlin' .  just give me an odd feelin' there a minute is all . 
gotta hex from a voodoo ? 
who do ?

never mind where .  .  .  get outta here .  .  .  i mean it sailor . 
i 'm goin' . 
who knows baby ? 
he was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the cafe du monde .  do you think he saw us ? 
lula darlin' .  .  .  makes no difference anyway .  .  .  we 're outta here . 
he 's just a regular guy't needs help honey .  look at him . 
i know you 're thinkin' that i got more 'n some of my mama in me ?  well i could n't help it .  sailor i really could n't .  i 'm sorry for that guy but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awfulsmellin' meat out of his pocket ?  i near barfed .  and them poor diseased puppies ! 
just part of life on the road peanut . 
do me a favor sailor ?  do n't pick up no more hitchers okay ? 
hard to tell what 's shakin' in a place like this honey .  you do n't want to be walkin' in the wrong door . 
maybe there 's a place we could hear some music .  i feel like dancin' .  we could ask someone . 
we 'll find out in a hurry . 
uh huh . 
you notice that woman when we come in ?  the white woman sittin' by herself ? 
yeah . 
well she ai n't talked to nobody and ai n't nobody spoke to her that i could tell .  what you make of that ? 
honey we bein' strangers here and all this is the kinda place we do n't want to make nothin' of nothin' . 
you think she 's pretty ? 
mama .  i been thinkin' about her .  she 's prob 'ly worried to death by now . 
more 'n likely . 
i want to call her and tell her i 'm okay .  that we 're okay . 
i ai n't so sure it 's a great idea but that 's up to you .  just do n't tell her where we are . 
pardon me ?  y 'all got a phone here i can use ? 
hey i heard all about it  the parents the grandparents the china town thing  and i believe you okay ?  that 's why we 're here .  now go get dressed . 
so sensitive . 
oh come on tripp .  cut the kid some slack . 
it 's just ail that crap he spins out .  just once i 'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth . 
the truth .  i know that 's always been real important to you .  okay check this out .  .  . 
yees ? 
i 'm afraid he 's pretty worn out poor kid . 
nevertheless .  there 's a police officer standing on the porch and i do n't think he 's going away . 
so what 's the problem ? 
there is no problem .  did i say there was a problem ? 
the chancellor 's here ?  now ? 
evidently .   coming ! 
great .  between you and officer pupcik out there he can be the next jean genet .  it 's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail . 
find the jacket . 
oh !  huh .  exactly how do we do that ? 
first i see if hannah will let me borrow her car . 
it seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas . 
do n't touch it . 
only now i 'm starting to think the car was n't exactly jerry 's to give . 
so whose car is it ? 
my guess  vernon hardapple . 
the hood jumper ? 
he said a few things that lead me to believe the car 's his . 
such as . 
'that 's my car motherfucker . '
uh huh .  so .  we find vernon we find the car .  we find the car .  .  . 
 .  .  . we find the jacket . 
there 's only one problem tripp .  we do n't know his real name .  we just made it up .  in fact we made the whole guy up . 
no wonder he screwed us over . 
that 's why she hates me .  that 's why she makes me sleep in the basement . 
in the crawl space with the rats and the casks of amontillado .  come on .  up . 
ah wear whatever you want . 
i 'm fine right .  fit as a fucking fiddle . 
it 's walter 's dog and yes she does know .  but let 's spare her the details .  come on your shoes are in the hail . 
i 'm not worried .  you 're not worried are you .  professor tripp ? 
i 'm a little worried james . 
do n't be .  i do n't care if they expel me .  i probably should be expelled . 
well let 's see if we can keep that from happening . 
yes james . 
even if i end up going to jail .  .  .  . 
i think maybe we 're missing the point .  it seems to me james' strength as a writer is that he does n't take us by the hand .  he treats us like adults .  he respects us enough to forget us .  that takes .  .  .  courage . 
i think so .  .  .  what about you ? 
me ?  sure .  why ? 
just checking . 
ail right .  by the way his friend .  .  .  ? 
the answer 's yes .  i think .  yes .  i do n't know .  where are they exactly ? 
james 'll know about george sanders . 
something wrong with that ? 
i was just thinking of .  .  .  the noise . 
i like the noise . 
what ? 
law says i ca n't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate .  i figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty .  make a bet ? 
no way man you 'd rob me blind ! 
you find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town and i 'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood . 
how is she ? 
annette ?  she 's good .  .  .  tense . 
when can i see her ? 
i 'm working on it . 
is it because of anna ? 
i do n't know .  she wo n't talk about it . 
you 're the only one in the family who still talks to me . 
i remember when they all referred to me as the little spic poor annette married .  except her brother .  you treated me with respect .   look you paid your dues .  your slate is clean now . 
how old is anna ? 
she 'll be twelve next week .  we 're throwing a big party on saturday .  wish i could ask you to come .  .  . 
only if it 's no closer than a hundred feet . 
this little table is one heavy bitch . 
huh ? 
it 's made from cherry .  that 's a hard wood . 
it 's a nice table . 
yeah .  it 's really nice . 
it was a beautiful present . 
then why the fuck are you giving it back to me ?  ! 
you need a table . 
she was going to throw it out was n't she ?  just toss it like a scrap of wood . 
it was n't like that . 
then what ?  what ?  ! 
she 's got all this new furniture now .  she said it did n't fit anymore so i kept it in the attic .  i thought you might like it . 
i made that table for you and annette for your wedding .  i put a lot of love into it . 
i know man .  i love this table too .   but i also love my wife . 
mariners are pounding the shit out of the tigers . 
fucking tigers .  they got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of double a or southern cal .   how was the party ? 
what party ? 
the birthday party . 
oh anna 's .  it was great man .  anna was so pretty .   she looked like a princess like one of those girls in a fairy tale you know like snow white . 
k through sixth . 
does n't it get noisy ? 
i like the noise . 
my place faces a truck street .  i 've got cracks in every window from the shaking . 
you must hate it . 
i go backpacking a lot .  lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two . 
what about them ? 
they could eat you . 
yeah they could . 
what ? 
you 're damaged . 
yeah ? 
i get that impression . 
so .  .  .  what 's your dark secret ? 
why do you want to know ? 
do n't you think i should know before we have sex ? 
what ? 
are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex ? 
not tonight . 
you 're still here . 
i did n't say i did n't enjoy it . 
of course .  sorry .  i 'm such a fucking asshole . 
no you 're not . 
do n't tell me i 'm not a fucking asshole when i know i 'm a fucking asshole ! 
you think i have a problem ? 
do you ? 
it 's been a while since .  .  . 
since you 've had sex ? 
maybe later . 
how about in the morning . 
the morning ? 
i thought i 'd stay the night . 
what for ? 
well walter this is going to sound offthewall but i like to sleep with a man after we fuck . 
how ? 
i do n't know how ! 
we 've only got one suit . 
i know !   i know !   but we better come up with something . 
aaargh !  !   i 'm freezing ! 
seven eight minute swim each way .  .  .  not enough time .   look at this .  .  .   time i get back you 'll be
what you growing gills all of a sudden ?   you got it on keep it on . 
do n't argue goddamnit just
no way !   forget it .   not an option . 
no !  !   now be logical bud you 're
fuck logic !  ! 
what 's the plan ? 
i drown you tow me back to the rig
what kind of plan is that !  ?  ? 
it 's the only way bud .   now trust me . 
tell me later . 
hi lady . 
hi tough guy .   i guess it worked huh ? 
'course is worked .   you 're never wrong are you ?  how d 'you feel . 
i 've been better .   next time it 's your turn okay ? 
who then ? 
hello mrs .  brigman . 
and that 's what i say too .  we could have all been killed . 
oh no .  .  .  please .  .  .  not here .   it looks too dangerous . 
and why have n't they left each other ? 
i 'm beginning to have my doubts .  it could n't be that they 're in love ? 
could be .  they 're the kind of people who are capable of anything . 
no . 
and why do you tell us this only now ? 
i .  .  .  i do n't know .  .  .  i did n't think it was worthwhile .  .  .  she was laughing over it .  .  . 
and how do you explain that ? 
but why do n't you tell him ?   a girl who was with us has disappeared . 
rather than being so occupied with my thoughts you would have been better off trying to understand what anna was thinking . 
i 'm sorry about last night .  please forgive me . 
you 're very fond of anna are n't you ? 
yes very much so . 
has she ever spoken to you about me ? 
occasionally but always with affection . 
and yet she seemed to feel that our love for her  mine yours even her father 's in a certain sense  were n't enough for her or did n't mean much to her . 
i know .  i keep asking myself what i could have done to prevent all this from happening . 
yes maybe that is better . 
i detest it .  but after all what can you do .  .  .  it 's the latest .  .  . and i try my best to adapt myself . 
if women's breasts were colored yours would be blue .  .  . 
you know i do n't love anybody . 
i know dammit i know !   and just think  if there ever was a woman so right so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations degradations infidelities .  .  .  of .  .   .  of .  .  .  of debaucheries it 's her .  well anyway she 's faithful .  faithful out of laziness .  .  .  of unwillingness . 
take it easy raimondo .  why are you getting so impatient ? 
claudia is n't coming with us .  will you please take care of her luggage ?  thanks . 
yes .  until proven otherwise . 
i would like to ask you something . 
wait a moment .  ca n't you see i 'm busy ? 
you 're kidding ! 
no i 'm not .  why do you think she does all this ?  it 's one of the many ways she can put herself on display .  when you bait the trap the mouse will snap .  to tell you the truth  if it was n't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month 's salary well .  .  .  but you had something you wanted to ask me ? 
oh .  .  .  i 'm sorry i have to rush but i 've got to write a story about this thing that just happened .  .  .  tell me exactly how it all turned out . 
now listen if i had any information i would n't have come here to ask you .  but i see that you too lack any information  .  .  . 
is that possible ? 
who knows ?  .  .  .  another one has it that she entered a store in troina .  this information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought i do n't know what in his store .  .  .  at troina . 
is that far from here ? 
about fifty miles or so .  if you want i 'll give you the name of the storekeeper . 
yes .  .  .  of course .  .  .  but you should also print that in your paper .  .  .  but right away tomorrow morning .  .  .  it 's the local palermo paper is n't it ?  .  .  .  i mean it 's widely read .  .  . 
yes but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now ?  even if i sent it the editors would n't print it . 
you really must do me this one favor . 
pardon me but why must i do you a favor ? 
then let 's call it a business proposition .  something to round out your salary . 
he talked to you himself ? 
no . 
through someone else ? 
yes . 
who ? 
i ca n't say . 
why ? 
she 'd punish me . 
one of the other sisters ? 
no . 
who ? 
no .  .  .  no .  .  .  i said leave her alone . 
you 're what ? 
if we want to hire a psychiatrist for agnes .  we 'll find our own thank you .  
one that will ask the questions you want asked . 
one that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect . 
for the church ? 
for agnes . 
you think she 's a saint ? 
she 's been touched by god yes . 
how ?   how ?   she hallucinates stops eating and bleeds spontaneously .  is that supposed to convince me she should n't be touched .  give me a miracle . 
the father ! 
who is he ? 
why must he be anybody ? 
my god you 're as crazy as .  .  . 
stop laughing i do n't say it 's the truth i 'm saying .  .  . 
how   ? 
do n't be ridiculous . 
well give me a reasonable explanation
a miracle is an event without an explanation .  if she 's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail why could n't she split a cell in her womb ? 
this is insane . 
there as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out . 
you 're saying god did it ? 
you 'll never find the answer for everything god did . 
i thought you did n't believe in miracles today mother ? 
but i want the opportunity to believe .  i want the choice to believe . 
but what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you wo n't face the fact that she was raped .  .  .  or seduced .  .  .  or that she did the seducing . 
she is an innocent . 
but she is not an enigma mother .  everything that agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry .  one two three right down the line . 
that 's what you believe she is ?   the sum of her psychological parts ? 
that 's what i have to believe .  .  . 
then why are you so obsessed with her ?  you 're losing sleep over her ?   you 're thinking about her all the time .  you 're bent on saving her .  why ? 
that 's crazy .  how could she find out about it ? 
somebody told her . 
who ?   that tun .  .  .  that tunnel has n't been used in fifty years . 
oh would you stop lying mother ! 
why would i lie ? 
because it 's murder we 're talking about .  are n't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room . 
i 'm concerned about her health . 
who was that person mother ?   was it you ? 
if you believe this is murder it is the crown attorney you have to talk to not me .  and definitely not agnes . 
where is she ? 
has n't she had enough ? 
i have a few more questions to ask her . 
my god but you 're determined . 
why do you insist upon pressing .  .  . 
was it you ? 
is it because she 's a nun ? 
did you know she was pregnant ? 
yes . 
and you did n't send her to a doctor . 
i did n't guess until it was too late . 
for what ?   an abortion ? 
oh do n't be ridiculous . 
too late for what ? 
i do n't know .  .  .  too late to stop it . 
the baby ? 
the scandal .  .  . 
you went to the room to help with the birth . 
she did n't want any help . 
you wanted that child out of the way . 
that 's a lie . 
you hid the wastepaper basket in her room . 
i did n't hide it .  i put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets . 
and the baby . 
no ! 
you tied the cord around its neck . 
i wanted her to have it when noone else was around they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them but it was such a difficult birth there was so much blood and i panicked . 
before or after you killed the child ? 
i left it with her and i went for help . 
i doubt that 's what she 'd say . 
then she 's a liar . 
agnes what happened to the baby ? 
she ca n't remember . 
what happened to the baby ? 
was n't it ! 
yes they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of liverpool .  scruffy young lads lacking even the price of a jam roll .  orphans every paddy 's son of em .  i saw their potential at once although i had me doubts about the little fella a savage primitive that ringo but it was him what gave in first .  he picked up a brick and heaved it at me and i quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes .  mister can you spare us a copper ?  he said .  i was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler  .  .  .  so i took them under me managerial banner . 
the usual ten per cent ? 
oh not at all i let them have twentyfive sure are n't there four of them ? 
how fascinating .  do go on  .  .  .    .  .  .  john .

what was that dell i lost you do you read me ? 
yeah but this is hard work .   ca n't talk now . 
wretched .   what happened to me ? 
do n't you remember ? 
do n't remember nothing .   ca n't hardly remember my name . 
god i 'm hungry . 
i think that 's a pretty reasonable request . 
i do n't know .  .  .  i 'm getting these ucrampsu ! 
uoh god it hurts so badu ! 
i have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin . 
a transmission ? 
a voice transmission . 
play it for us please . 
unknown . 
i 've got an idea but you 're not going to like it . 
and the creature with it .   we can make it back to irth in the lifeboat . 
our lives are more important .  anyway we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat . 
we can use the flamethrower . 
it 's not going to work . 
i should hope so !   and we 'd better make sure it 's pretty far from the ship when we blow it . 
hey look somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat ! 
is it armed ? 
if you press the button right now it will blow the whole nose of the ship off . 
thanks for the thought .  
feast your eyes . 
sandy can you home in on that beam ? 
what 's the frequency ? 
computer what 's the frequency of the transmission ? 
dell  show me that on a screen . 
now .   if we can get it into the boat we wo n't have to blow it up  we can just eject it into space . 
who gets the privilege ? 
and you 'll let me know when you 've got it coming this way .  .  . 
and you stand aside while we drive it in then shut the hatch launch the boat and 
kablooey .

do you want a tablet ? 
yeah .  .  . 
do you wanna head back and call it in ? 
ackland ?   i do n't know him well enough to say .   if we were back on earth we could run him though an aldhoven test and find out for sure .  there 's not much we can do out here . 
alright .   pull some trackers and headsets out of stores and i 'll sign a release for the weapons .   cassie organise a team roster and put it on the board .

i 'm out of ammo .   get inside get inside ! 
detour .   other way 's blocked .  .  .

the point is  in the cathedral a ball park or a penny arcade  we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends .

groom . 
yes dear . 
you know what i 'm going to be ? 
a cowboy . 
a married lady . 
with the paper to prove it . 
i 'm going to have a home .  not just a house i 'm afraid to stay in .  .  .  and a man to go with it .  i 'll look up at six o 'clock  and there he 'll be .  .  .  remember karen ? 
a foursquare upright downright forthright married lady .  .  .  that 's for me .  and no more make believe !  off stage or on .  .  .  remember lloyd .   i mean it now .  grownup women only i might even play a mother  only one child of course not over eight .  .  .   lloyd will you promise not to be angry with me ? 
it 's just that you get me so mad sometimes .  .  .  of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about
ai n't it the truth ? 
yes it is !  you 're talented famous wealthy  people waiting around night after night just to see you even in the wind and rain .  .  . 
autograph fiends !  they 're not people  those little beast who run in packs like coyotes
they 're your fans your audience
they 're nobody 's fans !  they 're juvenile delinquents mental detectives they 're nobody 's audience they never see a play or a movie even  they 're never indoors long enough ! 
you 've what ? 
she 's just outside the door . 
the heaveho . 
harrington . 
i 'm so sorry .  .  .  harrington .  wo n't you sit down ? 
i was telling margo and lloyd about how often you 'd seen the play .  .  . 
please do n't play governess karen i have n't your unyielding good taste i wish i 'd gone to radcliffe too but father would n't hear of it  he needed help at the notions counter .  .  .   i 'm being rude now are n't i ?  or should i say ai n't i ? 
i 'm so happy you 're happy . 
of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet
peace and quit is for libraries . 
roughly ten minutes . 
how far to the station ? 
three or four miles .  .  . 
any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas ? 
none in sight there are n't many along this back road .  .  . 
not many car either not much chance of a lift .  .  . 
it seems to me that walking for most people is not very dangerous . 
i just never think of lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down . 
be brave .  he 'll come back  with or without gas . 
it does n't matter . 
i detest cheap sentiment . 
you mean who 's going to play the mean m . p .  and who 's going to be the nice one ?   whichever . 
he 's another ivy leaguer so he 'll probably expect you to be understandingmight surprise him if you 're not . 
you want me to be the bastard . 
and i 'll just shitkick in my usual way . 
nothingi just found out that jeb magruder from creep is a bigger bike freak than i am .   i never like it when the other guy 's human .  .  . 
colson . 
we 'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it . 
the lookout in the motor inn ?   he say anything we do n't know ? 
just that a lot of reports were sent to creep but he does n't name who not here anyway
shit
we gotta top the times
i know i know
if we could name the guys got the reports we 'd be ahead again
shit who do we know ? 
i know a lawyer at justice
has he got an ax ? 
almost every source we 've used has been republican this guy 's a card carrying democrat . 
then he 's got an ax .   call him anyway . 
i have n't said anything
for the first time i 'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter woodward i got a tip .  a guy called me up with a tip  someone named donald segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they 'd like to go to work with him screwing up the democrats dirty tricks shit like that .  the fbi knows about segretti howard hunt made a bunch of phone calls to himthey interrogated him but on account of segretti was n't involved with the breakin they did n't follow through .  but segretti did a lot of travelinghe called these lawyers from different places and he told them the republicans knew what he was doing . 
how high up which republicans ? 
that 's what we 've got to find out but segretti went to southern cal .  and so did a bunch of nixon men
haldeman i know who else ? 
dwight chapin nixon's appointments chiefhe knew segretti in school .  maybe i 'm crazy but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense .  what were the three theories ? 
the burglary was done by cubans or democrats or republicans . 
now the reason no one believed the republicans is because there was n't any reason they were so far ahead .  but segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break in . 
so maybe watergate was n't really about watergatemaybe that was just a piece
because a year before the republicans were n't ahead not in the polls muskie was running ahead of nixon then .  before he self destructed . 
if he selfdestructed . 
segovia begged me for me secret but i said no andres you 'll have to try and make it without me . 
'cause i only know four chords
you asking would i have been one of the president 's men ?   i would have been . 
total manipulation .  i suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the constitution but they do n't think along philosophical lines . 
talk about segretti
do n't concentrate on segretti or you 'll miss the overall scheme too . 
there were more then . 
follow every leadevery lead goes somewhere
the canuck letterwas that a white house operation
do n't you miss the grand scheme too . 
how grand ? 
nationwidemy god they were frightened of muskie and look who got destroyedthey wanted to run against mcgovern and look who they 're running against .  they bugged they followed people false press leaks fake letters they canceled democratic campaign rallies they investigated democratic private lives they planted spies stole documents on and on do n't tell me you think this was all the work of little don segretti . 
and justice and fbi know all this ? 
yes yes everything .  there were over fifty people employed by the white house and creep to ratfuck some of what they did is beyond belief . 
fifty ratfuckers directed by the white house to destroy the democrats ? 
i was being cautious .   you can safely say more then fifty .  .  . 
you 've done worse than let haldeman slip away you 've got people feeling sorry for himi did n't think that was possible .  a conspiracy like this the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone 's neck .  you build from the outer edges and you go step by step .  if you shoot too high and miss then everybody feels more secure .  you 've put the investigation back months . 
we know thatand if we were wrong we 're resigningwere we wrong ? 
you 'll have to find that out wo n't you ? 
howard hunt here . 
hi i 'm bob woodward of the post and
yes yes what is it ? 
i was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at watergate ?

i would if you really ever wanted to know . 
i really want to know . 
nobody ever had too much . 
nobody gives a shit about the dahlberg repercussions
quit equivocating say what you mean  our story got government accounting to start an audit on creep 's finances
this white house guy a good one a pro came up and asked what is this watergate compulsion with you guys and i said well we think it 's important and he said if it 's so goddamn important who the hell are woodward and bernstein ? 
ask him what he 's really sayinghe means take the story away from woodstein and give it to his people at the national desk
well i 've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around would n't you say so ? 
absolutelyand that 's all they do sit sit sitevery once in a while they call up a senator some reporting

uh  forget that .   look is that all you 're interested in ?   ways to get your girlfriend into bed ? 
well no .   i think .  .  . i guess it would be good to be able to return the favor .   i mean it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as i do . 
that 's good that 's what i needed to hear .   now you qualify . 
qualify for what ? 
you 've just inherited the bible . 
what 's that ? 
it was you .  .  .  that night in the tunnels .  you .  you did this to me .

i do n't know .   i do n't see what this has to do with me . 
perhaps it 's because she has amnesia too  ca n't remember .   .   . 
i have my reasons . 
anastasia 's grandmother is in paris .   we 're going to bring anastasia to her  in paris .  
look  there is n't an orphan in the world who does n't dream she 's a princess but come on .   .   .   look at me !

i was never very good at history .  let me see  there was miss olsen and then there was miss rossi  no she came before  it was miss koch who came after miss olsen 
now fran 
and just think  right now there 's some lucky girl in the building who 's going to come after me 
okay okay fran .  i deserve that .  but just ask yourself  why does a man run around with a lot of girls ?  because he 's unhappy at home  because he 's lonely that 's why  all that was before you fran  i 've stopped running . 
it 's christmas eve fran  let 's not fight . 
merry christmas . 
yeah we better . 
i have a present for you .  i did n't quite know what to get you  anyway it 's a little awkward for me shopping    so here 's a hundred dollars  go out and buy yourself something . 
do n't ever talk like that fran !  do n't make yourself out to be cheap . 
a hundred dollars ?  i would n't call that cheap .  and you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment 
stop that fran . 
you 'll miss your train jeff .

fran why did you do it ?  it 's so childish  and it never solves anything  i ought to be very angry with you scaring me like that  but let 's forget the whole thing  pretend it never happened  what do you say fran ?   fran 
of course i 'm not here  because the whole thing never happened  i never took those pills  i never loved you  we never even met  is n't that the way you want it ?

that little punk  after all i did for him !  he said i could n't bring anybody to his apartment  especially not miss kubelik .  what 's he got against you anyway ?

no i 've seen those in normandy .  this is much better .   my country  my country could never originate this .  magnificent . 
of course .  i  once we make our repairs we could send word we could have you evacuated from here . 
captain ? 
you 'll get blown outta here some day . 
we will never evacuate' captain  this is our home .  indochina is ours it has been so for a hundred and twentyone years there is something to say for that . 
the vietnamese think it 's theirs  i guess the americans do too . 
but we civilized it .  a place belongs to those who bring light to it do n't you agree . 
i always thought the french came here to get the rubber . 
do you know that jungle ? 
when i was a boy my father would take me there to hunt .  there are a few savages but no man can live there no white man . 
what about an american named kurtz ? 
your daughter . 
we endure captain  you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar  destroy that and we 'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it .  burn the forest and we 'll hide in the swamp .  all the while we do but one thing  clean the blood off our bayonets .   au revoir captain .

i 'd sure like that favor you offered a while back . 
168  continued
your infrared camera ? 
keep back . 
i was making my rounds saw your hangar wide open plane getting rained on so i closed it up . 
26   continued  
question is why they sat here when the storm moved in .   check their stuff while i sniff around . 
28   continued
what are you talking about ? 
bastards killed sam you think they wo n't kill the rest of us ? 
there 'll be three four men at the most .   i have some backup nothing will happen . 
i 'm real sorry .   in a while you 're gone from this country .  but we live here .   no one wants to mix it up with those hombres . 
 sam wilder was my cousin .  he 's why i came to alaska .   all his letters saying what a paradise it is .   but me ending up dead wo n't do sam a lick of good . 
you 're an outsider mr .  desmond .  step aside stay out of it . 
what does this matter to you ? 
you ca n't see past your lousy little assignment sniffing around the pipeline .   the few voters there are in this district look up to corbett and i 'm not about to alienate them . 
i should release corbett because you want some votes ? 
this miserable wilderness is a state of the union .   policy 's made here the same way as in the civilized world at the ballot box .   that 's the beauty of it  these icebox cowboys are living a century too late .   get them on your side it 's like buying manhattan for beads .   with a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the new world . 
some day these people 'll wake up and you 'll be the first one they 'll run out of here . 
fuck you . 
this is n't your concern .   it 's over here and now . 
 we appreciate the company .  anne marie 's getting cabin fever already . 
mobile arctic dwelling  mad . 
damn .   likely that 's an sos .  have to pass on that lunch .

that 's what we should 've done in the first place . 
i could 've sat tight for the transport til bob came poking around . 
i 'll take a bus . 
i 'll take you .  .  .  why not ? 
i do n't care what you did for me .  i do n't think i want to know you anymore  all you do is make me feel badly about myself .   you have my number . 
yeah .  .  .  well .  .  . 
how you doing ? 
i can trust my brain . 
that seems like a good choice . 
i do n't know whether i 'm being sensible or hard on you . 
the two might go together . 
see .  there 's an example .  i do n't know whether you 're being cute or crazy now . 
cute . 
you do n't have to answer everything i say .  just listen to me .  okay ? 
go ahead . 
i should 've danced with you .

what are you doing here ? 
what a break .  .  . 
is it a secret what you 're doing here ? 
i had to see you .  .  . 
because .  .  . 
it relaxes me .  .  .  i 'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else i can think of or imagine . 
oh come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you . 
maybe we could live without the wise cracks . 
see .  it 's four in the morning .  a walk sounds a little screwy to me if you do n't mind . 
if you need an excuse there 's a bakery on the corner .  there 's a shot it 'll open soon  that way we 're not screwy  we 're just two people who like warm rolls . 
okay . 
melvin even though it may seem that way now  you do n't know me all that well .  .  .   i 'm not the answer for you . 
you know what ?  i .  .  . 
just let me talk .   i 'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you 're the greatest woman on earth .  i 'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do  in every single thought you have .  .  .  in how you are with spencer  spence .  .  .    .  .  .  in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that 's all about being straight and good .  .  . 
i 'm gonna grab you .   i did n't mean it to be a question .  i 'm gonna grab you .

ca n't afford to take chances . 
wanta sue me ?

who 're you ? 
new jersey ? 
fortysix yoyodyne employees .   grover 's mill new jersey 11138 . 
you mean the guy from the old wine commercials ? 
halloween .  1938 .  .  . war of the worlds .  .  . that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared thinking that real live martians were landing in grover 's mill new jersey !   but then it all just turned out to be a hoax . 
then that 's it ! 
nothing to apologize for casper .   you 've gone beyond the call of duty tonight .   mind if i get on the horn and radio the cavaliers ?   they 'll be worried . 
you wanna take the chance casper ? 
not me .  no way . 
rawhide go find out how professor hikita 's coming with that formula .  mrs .  johnson take casper and scooter gas up the jet car . 
they 're stealing my chopper ! 
the creatures ?   they attacked you ?   they tried to possess you ? 
buckaroo i 've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the jet car drive shaft . 
i 'm assigning a couple blue shields to protect you around the clock just in case . 
audrey thank you for coming .  thank you .   i 'm sorry to be such a .  .  .  such a .  .  .  thank you . 
yes .  thank you .  how 's bill ? 
oh he 's .  .  .  he drifted off .  he 'll sleep for a while now .  what is it you have to do exactly ? 
it 's alright barton .  you do n't have to write actual scenes ? 
no but the whole goddamn  audrey ?  have you ever had to read any of bill 's wrestling scenarios ? 
what are they like ?  what are they about ? 
well usually they 're .  .  .  simply morality tales .  there 's a good wrestler and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end .  in between the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect .   bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type or a convict .  and sometimes instead of a waif he 'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild .   the studio always hated that .  oh some of the scripts were so .  .  .  spirited ! 
you wrote his scripts for him ? 
well the basic ideas were frequently his
you wrote bill 's scripts !   jesus christ you wrote his  what about before that ? 
before what ? 
before bill came to hollywood . 
what do you mean so to speak ?  !  audrey how long have you been his .  .  .  secretary ? 
barton i think we should concentrate on our little project
i want to know how many of bill 's books you wrote ! 
barton ! 
i want to know ! 
barton honestly only the last couple
hah ! 
and my input was mostly .  .  .  editorial really when he 'd been drinking
i 'll bet .  jesus  the grand productive days .  what a goddamn phony . 
that 's hamburger grease bill . 
well m 'olfactory 's turnin' womanish on me  lyin' and deceitful .  .  . 
that does n't help anything bill . 
bill 
not anything bill .  do n't test me . 
 .  .  . both maybe ? 
boy !  you writers !  work hard play hard !   that 's what i hear anyway .  .  .

a friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery .  he 's an electrician .  i was supposed to be there an hour ago . 
c 'mon baby i painted them for you .  they 're beautiful now . 
i 'm going to my parents this weekend .  what am i going to wear ?   how could you do that to me ? 
you do n't have any fucking money .  . 
i have but one pet cause today ban the bat . 
oh him again .   he 's already history  check it out . 
he 'd have more power as a martyr .  no to destroy batman we must first turn him into what he hates most .   meaning us . 
you 're quick .   mayor cobblepot . 
you 're off the hook ozzie .   but batman is decidedly unotu . 
well a plan uisu forming  .  .  .  a vicious one involving the loss of innocent life  .  .  . 
i want in .   the thought of busting batman makes me feel all  .  .  .  dirty .   maybe i 'll give myself a bath right here  .  .  . 
i would n't touch you to scratch you . 
i oughta have you spayed !   you sent out all the signals ! 
did i ?   only cause my mom trained me to with a man .  .  .  any man all men   corn dog ! 
the name is oswald cobblepot . 
dad !   save yourself ! 
she jumped .   she 'd been depressed . 
yes .   uyesu .   boyfriend trouble  .  .  ? 
pms . 
women .  .  .  nothing surprises me chip .  excepting your late mother .  .  .  who even knew selina had a brain to damage ?   bottom line  she tries to blackmail us we drop her out a higher window .   meanwhile i got badder fish to fry .   yeah  oswald please . 
can i get some help over here ? 
what ?   i 'm sorry .   you were saying .  .  . 
we 've been going out over a year now and .  .  . okay here goes .   bruce i want to spend my life with you . 
i know you 're a dedicated bachelor .  that you 've had a your wild nights . 
wild does n't exactly cover it . 
but there 's nothing you 've done under the cover of darkness i could n't learn to understand . 
i would n't bet on that . 
i 'm betting on you .   you 'll make someone a good husband one day .  but i ca n't wait around forever .  do n't answer now .   just think it over .   here 's some food for thought . 
what ? 
you just called me ivy .   who 's ivy ? 
i wish i knew . 
bruce ?   what are you doing ? 
well .  .  . um .  .  . her . 
you were right .   i get it .   you 're not the marrying kind .   you 've made your point .   goodbye bruce wayne . 
somehow he survived .   but the cryoslution mutated his body . 
presumed dead .   no one knows . 
let me get this straight .  a brilliant citizen disfigured by a horrible accident reemerges as a psychotic supervillain bent on theft revenge and destruction .  you see a pattern here ? 
maybe it 's something in the water . 
we gonna trap ourselves a snowman ? 
absolutely .   just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator . 
whoa i made a mistake .   i 'm sorry .  do n't go all protective on me .   it wo n't happen again . 
dick you were reckless .   you could have been killed . 
i 'm fine .   see .   me .   here .   alive .  how are we gonna work together if you 're never going to trust me ? 
excuse me . 
i figure telling that cop i 'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will .  so no offense but thanks .  see ya . 
i got no place at the circus without my family .  i 'm going to get a fix on twoface .  then i 'm going to kill him . 
listen dick .  killing twoface wo n't take the pain away .  it 'll make it worse . 
look spare me the sermons okay .  you 're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed .  you do n't even know me . 
absolutely not . 
me and my brother chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire .  dad 's knee was going .  chris was engaged you know that ?  twoface took .  .  . everything .  now i can pay him back . 
what i do is n't about revenge . 
you do n't understand .  it 's an addiction .  you fight night after night trying to fill the emptiness .  but the pain's back in the morning .  and somewhere along the way it stops being a choice .   i want better for you . 
save the sermons about how great you want my life to be okay bruce ?  if it were n't for batman my parents would n't be dead .  you do n't get it do you ?  this is all your fault . 
you have a real gratitude problem .  you know that bruce ?  i need a name .  batboy ?  the dark earl ?  what 's a good side kick name ? 
how about richard grayson college student ? 
 .  .  . i missed twoface by a heartbeat .  when we catch him you gotta let me kill him ! 
we do n't kill .  killing is what damns you .  it .  what am i talking about ?  this conversation is over .  you 're going away to school . 
i saved your life .  you owe me .  so either you let me be your partner or i 'm going after harvey on my own . 
dick let go .  revenge will eat you alive .  trust me .  i know . 
but what about all the good we can do ?  there are monsters out there .  gotham needs us . 
and when you finally get twoface ? 
bruce you ca n't . 
chase is coming for dinner .  why do n't you join us . 
of course you are .  and what a grand pursuit you must be .   what do you think of my new invention ? 
who is it ? 
it 's dr .  meridian .  chase .  do you remember me ? 
how could i forget ? 
dr .  burton tells me you know who batman is . 
yesssssss .  i know ! 
ca n't tell if you do n't say please . 
you 're right edward .  i did n't mean to be impolite .  please . 
very good idea jack .   in fact    i 'd like you to handle this operation personally . 
because i want someone i can trust . 
oh jack .    do n't forget your lucky deck . 
jack ?   thank god .   i ca n't believe it 's you .   i heard you 'd been 
is that what you heard ? 
i 've died once already .   it was n't so bad  in fact i recommend it . 
jack ?   jack ?   do i look like a jack ? 
ha !   that 's the best part .  i ca n't !  ! 
i 've considered that possibility . 
and what happens if we say no ? 
nobody wants a war carmine .   if we ca n't do business we shake hands and part friends . 
that 's it ? 
that 's it . 
i 'd like to read a prepared statement .  while this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace . '
huh .  demands .  well gents this is kinda embarrassing but .  .  .  i 'm having such a swell time i just have n't thought any up . 
ten million dollars .  ten mi  you cheapskates !  i 've just wiped out the stock market .  i 've cost you billions !   i want ten million and one . 
please !  we 'll talk .  just tell us what you expect . 
goddammit i expect to be treated like and artist .  get off my screen !  ! 
i 'm fired ?   because i let a .  .  .  copy of a painting the get stolen ? 
of course not .   i 'm sacking you for neglectful conduct relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred through your recent lack of professional judgement .   a loss i trust bernie will be able to reverse . 
very accommodating well no sir i 'm sure  .  .  . 
and a car . 
mmmmm .  .  . 
a car sounds sensible . 
and i need fridays off to spend more time with my family .   speaking of which  if you 'll excuse me  .  .  .  .  i 've got a lot of time to make up . 
what makes you say that ? 
all the guys they claim are english to and goodlooking like dan day lewis and liam neeson turn out to be irish .   even anthony hopkins is welsh .   prince charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors . 
richard burton was very goodlooking . 
welsh . 
sean connery . 
okay so the guy 's gonna look like meatloaf 's backside .   noone 's asking you to go to bed with him . 
there 's a man .   i woke up next to a man  .  .  . 
it 's you and mom that need to talk . 
sure .   you 're right . 
ah  .  .  .  jennifer i need you to watch kevin .   jen ? 
not in one piece anyway .   i see mrs whistler as kind of  .  .  .  like my own dear mother .   i 'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her .   the vice president here will vouch for that . 
 .  .  . oooeieeeooooeeeooooo .  .  . 
thrr .  .  . 
dammit !   where 's that damn unit ?  ?  !  ! 
chief we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving dallas' room shortly before we arrived . 
did you give him a full cavity search ? 
ah the witness ? 
yes .  you can never be too careful bork . 
well sir i did n't really think it was necessary .  you see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam .  here have a look . 
bork do n't you realize what kids today are capable of ?  do n't you read the papers ? 
i see it .  i do n't get it . 
you got half the state looking for ya  how do you get away ? 
cut the power ! 
damn right .  bork we 're dealing with real pros here .  my opinion terrorists .  .  .  what 's the scoop on that stolen unit ? 
well sir it 's not good .   roll the tape .  .  .  the x5 unit is a new topsecret biological weapon a manmade virus .  .  . 
it gets worse .  the unit was n't finished .  it has a flaw  the casing .  if hit hard enough it could break open releasing the virus . 
deep and hard . 
bork !  you are a federal agent .  you represent the united states government .  .  .  never end a sentence with a preposition .  try again . 
oh ah .  .  .  you know that guy in whose camper they .  .  .  i mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking ? 
that 's better .  yes ? 
we 've run a sample through the national criminal sperm bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father .  
where did these guys come from ? 
d . c .  chief . 
jesus jumpedup .  .  .  bork can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital or even worse if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference .   well it 's not gonna happen ! 
i got an a ! 
uhuh .   only if you got uaboveu a c on science . 
oh puhleeze ! 
w .  .  .  we did n't know how to make one . 
good luck .   you 're going to use up all your help vouchers . 
help vouchers ? 
d90 's .   you spend a hundred and twentyfive years on earth actually in that house during which you get only three class one d90 intercessions with juno .  you probably have n't even read through the manual completely yet . 
for juno your caseworker .   not that it matters to your type .   but there uareu all these other people here ahead of you .   i 'd say three hours . 
hell no !   i 'm rolling .   i 'm a businessman .   i 'm the man what uamu .  ubeeeutel ujoooseu !   uwhou do i gotta kill ? 
you do n't kill anyone . 
but .  .  .  the deetzes are udestroyingu our house . 
you maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife .   so what 's my cut ? 
can you scare them off ? 
hi ho hi ho it 's off to work i go ! 
you wish !   i nearly scored with that little blonde .   i need me a short little queen . 
now let 's get rolling ! 
i do n't know . 
what happened to the people who used to live here ? 
that 's a skeleton key .   it 'll open any door in that house .   will you give it to your father ?   and you might mention that i singlehandedly decorated the house .   in case he needs advice in that area .   come see me . 
yes but i 'm going to live at home . 
remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code .   i 'm sure you 're going to be very happy there . 
it 's okay .   how 's the dirt business ? 
well i just placed a call to your mother .   she had stepped out but i have some news for her . 
hold your breath and we 'll pull . 
my sentiments exactly .   porcelain is for teeth ! 
why not ? 
the attic . 
that 's slavery and murder .   you do n't know these people .   they 're just like you and me .   they 're nice people ! 
reluctant to speak eh chauncey ?  well i can understand that .  when a man loses everything anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time .  just give it some thought work with the idea i 'm sure you 'll have plenty to say in a few days . 
i could give it some thought ben but my leg is very sore . 
 .  .  .  oh ?   robert take a look would you ? 
yes ben .  my leg is not very sore . 
well that 's good news my boy . 
you 're looking much better today ben . 
hah !  it 's all makeup chauncey .  .  .  i asked nurse teresa to fix me up i did n't want the president to think i was going to die during our talk . 
i understand . 
no one likes a dying man my boy  because few know what death is .  all we know is the terror of it .  but you 're an exception chauncey  that 's what i admire in you your marvelous balance .  you do n't stagger back and forth between fear and hope  you 're a truly peaceful man . 
thank you ben .    .  .  .  the nurse did a very good job ben . 
i see ben . 
 .  .  .  maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position chauncey .  .  .  maybe one day .  .  . 
yes .  that is correct . 
yes ben  he is . 
he was quite impressed with your comments chauncey  he hears my sort of analysis from everyone but yours unfortunately  seldom if ever at all . 
i 'm glad he came ben .  it was nice talking to the president . 
no ben . 
oh sure you do the financial assistance program .  i think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking .  i 'd like you to meet with the members of the board we 'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time . 
i understand . 
and please chauncey  do n't rush your decision .  i know you 're not a man to act on the spur of the moment . 
thank you ben . 
and now chauncey i 'm afraid you must excuse me  i 'm very tired all of a sudden . 
senator rowley 's widow sophie is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring ambassador skrapinov of the soviet union .  .  .  i think it 's rather obvious that robert wo n't allow me to attend so  would you go in my place and escort eve ? 
yes .  i would like to escort eve . 
good .  together the two of you should create quite a stir  i can already hear the gossip . 
yes ben  are you going to die now ? 
oh i see . 
let me feel the strength in your hand chauncey .  .  .  let me feel your strength .  .  .   yes that 's good .  .  .  i hope chauncey  i hope that you 'll stay with eve .  .  .  take care of her watch over her she 's a delicate flower chauncey .  .  . 
a flower .  .  . 
she cares for you and she needs your help chauncey .  .  .  there 's much to be looked after .  .  . 
yes .  i would like to do that . 
 .  .  .  i 've worked very hard and enjoyed my life .  .  .  i 've known success .  .  .  and i 've felt love .  .  .  my associates chauncey  i 've talked with them about you .  .  .  they 're eager to meet you .  .  .  very eager to meet you .  .  .  i 'm very fond of you chauncey .  .  .  and i understand eve .  .  .  tell her that .  .  .  tell her i 'm madly in love with her .  .  . 
i like to watch . 
watch ?  you mean just watch me ?  doing it alone ? 
yes .  i like to watch very much . 
well if that 's what you want then i want it too .   we can go this way . 
i want to tell eve . 
tell eve ?  you mean mrs .  rand ? 
yes . 
oh you can tell her later .  she 'll never miss you in this crowd . 
tell your friends . 
oh i will and i have many many friends and associates my friend .  all by the way in overeaters anonymous .  all of them fat and alone like me all of them dream of being someone else all of them with john malkovich as their second choice ! 
gotta run .  shipment of grub worms coming in first thing . 
enjoy . 
craig listen honey i 've been thinking .  .  .  maybe you 'd feel better if you got you know a job or something . 
we 've been over this .  nobody 's looking for a puppeteer in today 's wintry economic climate . 
well you know maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around . 
the great mantini does n't need a day job . 
craig everyone ca n't be derek mantini .   well grub worms are waiting .  do me a favor ?

they 'll understand .  besides i 've got a morning appointment tomorrow with elijah 's shrink .  we 're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach . 
hmmm . 
some sort of childhood trauma she thinks .  possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp .  interesting huh ? 
hmmm .

just an idea i had . 
hi . 
sorry i 'm so late .  lester just would n't let me go .  were supposed to have dinner with him on friday .  i can get us out of it if you want .  he 's really amazing this insane old lech .  it 's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is . 
nah .  i 'm not hungry .  i 'm sorry i did n't call .  it was just you know hard to get away . 
i was worried . 
i 'm sorry .  how was your evening ? 
tomtom 's puncture wound is infected . 
the ferret ? 
the iguana .

i dressed the wound .  then i 've just been feeding everyone putting everyone to bed . 
yeah .  you want a beer ? 
no thanks .  i 'm going to turn in . 
all right .  i 'll be in my workshop for a little while .  i 'll be in in a little while .  i need to unwind a little .   i 'll be in soon .  a little while . 
'kay . 
brain .  soul i 'm telling you lotte .  i was right inside him looking out .  we 're going to be rich . 
i want to try .

we 'll see schwartz .  we 'll see . 
a friendly competition if you will .  your malkovich puppet and my harry s .  truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play .  not some vegas burlyq pyrotechnics but a real play that requires actual acting .  the audience decides who is more deserving of the title .  the losing puppeteer bows out graciously .  goes back to obscurity as a file clerk . 
what 's the play ? 
say .  .  .  equus ?  it 's got everything . 
never heard of it . 
broadway 's finest three hours .  it 's about the suppression of the individual .  conformity as god in modern society . 
sounds boring .  are there any songs ? 
nothing but acting to hide behind buddyboy . 
i 'm not afraid .  i toured for a year with the national puppet company 's production of long day 's journey into night . 
great then . 
is there dancing ? 
no . 
who needs dancing ? 
mr .  malkovich ? 
who 's calling ? 
you do n't know me but i 'm a great admirer of yours . 
how 'd you get this number ? 
it 's just that i fantasize about you and well speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and .  .  . 
whatever you 're having .

yeah .   that 's a great plan walter .  that 's fucking ingenious if i understand it correctly .   that 's a swiss fucking watch . 
thaaat 's right dude .   the beauty of this is its simplicity .  if the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong .   if there 's one thing i learned in nam
what 'd he say ?   where 's the hand off ? 
there is no fucking handoff walter !  at a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car ! 
huh ? 
we throw the money out of the moving car ! 
like cancer with a purpose . 
exactly .   look at the digestive system .  it 's been drastically simplified .   super charged .   and this 
you do n't have to hunt to do it . 
really ?   what are we supposed to do then ?   starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live ?   what about that scumbag you just let off the hook ?  a nothing .   a drugdealer .   how do you justify saving people like that ? 
fry em . 
save it .   i do n't want to hear your words .   let 's do this now !  !  ! 
what ? 
each day is a little life .   every waking and rising a little birth every fresh morning a little youth every going to rest and sleep a little death . 
i do n't think so . 
for what ? 
it would 've been easy for you to let me die back there today but you did n't . 
i would n't read too much into it . 
why ? 
because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends . 
it does n't have to be like that .   we do n't have to be enemies . 
get real .   i was useful to damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on .   now that it 's over all bets are off . 
if that 's true then why 'd you save me ? 
i am a hunter .   a weapon .   it 's what i do .   it 's in my blood . 
well it 's in mine too .   i 'm a pureblood .   i was n't turned .   i was born this way .   just like you .   am i evil because i want to survive ?   what about a wolf ?   what about any predator ? 
pain cuts the deepest is n't that what you said ? 
how can you tell ? 
the way they move they way they smell

those are n't real memories .  no one has that kind of recall . 
i do .  i remember from day one .  people staring at me sensing i was different .  watching the fear grow in their eyes knowing in their hearts i was n't human . 
if you 're not human then why do you bleed like us ?  i 've seen vampire blood you do n't have it running through your veins .

i 've seen those in magazines .   they 're not cheap . 
mirtha comes from a very wealthy family . 
oh i see . 
mom . 
i 'm just happy that george has found someone he cares for . 
yes .   of course .   but i 'm talking about that ring .   it 's something else .   let me tell you . 
that 's right .   layaway .   something you would n't know anything about you cheapskate . 
who 's the cheapskate ? 
you you big old tightwad .   he still has his communion money .   tell him george .  tell your father about layaway . 
look at this credenza .   if you do n't mind me asking how much is something like that ?   it 's got to cost a fortune . 
actually it was three . 
the man who gives us the airplanes .   the man from america .   the mafia .   chicago .  boom boom .   hollywood .   you are going to open for us the gates of hollywood george ? 
it would be my pleasure . 
good .   very good .   welcome my friend .  welcome to my country . 
un sapo ? 
un rata  no good .   but he could have run fled the country .   gone to the policia .   but then his wife his children his parents his friends many people would die . 
yes . 
but never mind .   i am thinking we can do much together .   this problem with diego the stolen car the jail is very silly business .   to release him from the carcel it causes me much inconvenience .  the fifty kilos could have been a big problem .   and i do n't like problems . 
with all respect padrino .   diego is my partner .   i do not do business without him . 
yes it is . 
so you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country george ? 
yes sir .   as much as you can give me . 
as much as i can give you ?   ha ha .   very good .   i like that .   come george .   let us drive .   we have much to talk about . 
it 's beautiful . 
people tell me that i am crazy .   that my business will never work in your country .   what do you think george ? 
not enough . 
no it 's better if he does n't .  the house is filled with new people . 
yes but we must also show them that we still exist . 
of course .  as soon as possible . 
no immediately .  the people are demoralized .  leave this to me  .  .  . 
no .  not you or any one of us .  as long as we are free the nlf continues to exist in the casbah .  if they manage to take us too there wo n't be anything left  .  .  .  and from nothing comes nothing  .  .  . 
men have two faces one that laughs and one that cries  .  .  . 
sure  .  .  . 
here ? 
with the others .  they are trying to stop the people . 
go away . 
let 's try  .  .  . 
it 's a question of habit  .  .  . 
i think it 'll be a success  .  .  . 
yes i think so too  .  .  .  it 's been organized well  .  .  .  but what will the french do ? 
no . 
did mr .  marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to miss lawson about his illness ? 
no . 
did miss lawson ever accompany mr .  marsh inside during his examinations ? 
no . 
then you have no way of knowing what mr .  marsh told miss lawson were the reasons for his visits ? 
no .   no i do n't . 
oriental medicine . 
and is miss lawson a patient of yours ? 
yes .   i 've been seeing her for over a year . 
why does she come to you ? 
she suffers from severe menstrual cramps . 
yes . 
what did you prescribe for her ? 
chinese peony root . 
would you describe for the court what chinese peony root looks like ? 
it 's a white powder that comes in a vial . 
i tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water . 
a previous witness stated that she saw miss lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on october twentyeighth .   according to your records when did you prescribe the drug ? 
one last question doctor .   if someone did n't know better would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine ? 
yes  quite easy . 
no . 
high school ? 
no . 
then  those are not your own words ? 
no . 
what else did the district attorney 's office tell you to say ? 
yes . 
where did you meet him ? 
i 'm a nurse .   i used to work at roseburg memorial hospital .   dr .  paley 's on staff there . 
what was the nature of your relationship with dr .  paley . 
we dated for about a month last year . 
then what happened ? 
i realized he was n't serious .   he was seeing other women  asking other nurses at the hospital out so i ended it . 
he used to call me  tell me that i could n't just walk out on him .   he said that if i did n't come back he 'd make my life miserable . 
did he make your life miserable ? 
yes  he did . 
how ? 
he laughed  and basically said he would decide when it was over . 
do you remember his exact words ? 
yeah  fine .   excuse me .   i 'll be right back . 
we have to talk . 
what 's wrong ? 
that 's what i was hoping you 'd tell me . 
where have you been ? 
charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you .   you were with her were n't you ? 
yes . 
why did you lie to me ? 
because i knew you 'd think exactly what you 're thinking . 
i 'm not . 
you 're sleeping with her are n't you ? 
no . 
it 's bad enough that you are .   it 's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me . 
maybe it would be a good idea if you just took michael . 
talk to me . 
we ca n't pretend this is n't happening . 
please  not now . 
why did n't you come to me ? 
i do n't know . 
you used to like to touch me  to make love to me . 
it 's more involved than that . 
it was a place to start . 
you think that 's the answer ?   sex ?  is that what you want ?   you want me to make love to you ? 
i do n't want our lives ruined because of this .   i love you frank .   i want this to work  but you have to help me .   you have to come back from where ever it is you are . 
is this what you want  huh ?   is it ? 
that 's too bad . 
no it 's not .   now i get to pitch . 
michael you should n't be happy when someone else is n't feeling well . 
not even if they 're a dork ? 
not even if they 're a dork .   you should go by and see how he 's feeling . 
what ? 
right now .  tell me someplace you 've been  someplace on the other side of the world .  anywhere but here . 
how about italy ? 
yes . 
how about bari ? 
yes .  tell me about the day you got off the train . 
have you ever been to that station ? 
yes . 
you know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas .  .  . 
it 's okay .  it 's not that hot anymore .  thanks god . 
why ? 
why !  ?  because i 'm having thoughts i hardly know what to do with .  i .  .  .  ca n't seem to .  .  .  stop them . 
nobody 's asking you to . 
and arraccinos and zeppolis .  yes !  i know it ! 
i sat outside and had coffee . 
where ?  near the doorway or the near the front of the church ? 
near the church . 
i sat there once .  it was hot .  like today .  i 'd been shopping .  i had all these bags around my feet i kept having to move every time the waiter came by .  .  . 
he 's a genius .  they 're not photographs  they 're stories entire histories captured in moments . 
i bet you could do a book . 
no .  i could n't . 
why do you say that ? 
because i already tried once . 
no i do n't mind . 
trouble .  why ? 
i just wondered .  why were you trouble ? 
i had a temper . 
what were your parents like ? 
what ? 
try and live a lifetime before friday .  cram it all in .  
just that it 's been a perfect day and that i 'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this . 
uhhuh .  and ? 
you 're right you know .  we do n't have much time . 
across the street .  she went into the park and got turned around and did n't know her way out . 
long day .  go to sleep . 
am i too heavy for you ? 
no . 
mother !   no . 
my god .   my dress .   we have to find it .  and burn it .   and shut the door . 
you moved into this block ? 
naw .   but they will be .   they 're the best . 
how do you know ? 
i manage them . 
anytime .   be seeing you . 
that place is already bad luck . 
why ? 
no .   it goes way back .   or so my momma says . 
what else does she say ? 
nothing .   you 'd think she was crazy .   and she is a lot of things not all of them nice but crazy momma 's not . 
way i figure everything our parents tell us is part true and part total b . s .   and our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which . 
my momma says every house is two houses .  every street two streets .   there 's a whole city a whole world kinda beside on top just below this one .   the city of the dead . 
like right now there 's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us ?   fingers rotting off ? 
maybe .   but there 's an invisible wall a fabric that kinda keeps things separate . 
lucky thing . 
yeah .   but when something bad happens something really bad  the wall breaks .  the fabric tears . 
the dead get out ? 
or the living fall in .   who knows . 
and you believe her ? 
if i did i would n't come within fifty yards of your door . 
what ?   oh yeah .   coming . 
believe me my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here .   all he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this hood as possible . 
he probably thinks he 's saving you from something .   i 'm sure that 's what my mother thinks . 
i 'm sure i can make your mother like me .  but then do i gotta worry bout your father ? 
it 's alright .   if you want to go home .  .  . 
no i want to stay with you guys .   but i ca n't .   i mean i 'm not ready . 
do n't worry about it .   i 'll stay with the boys . 
my old man calls the shots .   he built that gate and these damn walls . 
caesar what are you going to do ? 
what do you think we 're going to do ?  we have to find the money . 
what ? 
once we have the money then none of this ever happened . 
caesar you just killed gino marzzone . 
no i did n't .   not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here .   then they never showed up . 
what happened to them ? 
i do n't know .   we may never know but i 'm going to guess it was a job maybe the karpoli family . 
caesar what are we going to do ? 
they 're just cops .   stall them as long as you can . 
caesar someone could see us out here . 
where then ? 
i do n't know .   it could be anywhere .  we do n't even know if he was alone .  please caesar we do n't have much time .   let 's get out of here . 
we 're going to need some time . 
who are you going to call ? 
just hurry . 
do n't tell him 
shut up violet ! 
he ca n't kill you 
not until he has the money ! 
caesar stop acting like an asshole and think 
do n't try to tell me what to do . 
you need the money just like we do . 
shut up violet . 
let us go and we 'll make a deal . 
everything you could n't . 
poor boy has to work so hard . 
waiting in the apartment next door . 
an accident . 
shit !   oh shit ! 
he wo n't . 
trust me violet . 
if he does  .  .  . 
when i get the scotch how do i know you wo n't take off ? 
the same way i 'll know that you went to scotch .   trust . 
not caesar . 
why ? 
because of what you are going to tell him .   you have to make it as real as you can .   the moment you open the door with the scotch in your hand you will be covered and that moment is the most important moment in the plan . 
c !   shit i 'm sorry ! 
if he runs everyone will assume he took the money . 
you 'll be clean and we 'll be rich . 
what ? 
get everyone down in the basement . 
you 're in danger .   all of you .   i have no time to explain . 
wait a minute 
i 'm sorry .

i 'm all right .  i just ca n't stand to see people tied up .   i 'm in the waiting room for hours listening to noel screaming .  the only reason he 's screaming is cause he 's tied up .

i 'm aware of that .  we do n't have to turn this into a big deal .   okay ?  we do n't have to have a fight .  it was important to me .  but forget it .  just something i wanted to do for myself .

uh i have a plane to catch to cleveland .  .  .   can i get my winnings ? 
sorry sir .  the cult is my life and my life is the cult .  by god captain god i shall not fail you .  . 
crowd always buys it .  what do we got ? 
i still have to call my agentmy technosingle just made the hot 100 .  .  . what 's with the phone ? 
you have to dial nine first . 
it 's okay .  let her go . 
go together ?   sure why not ?   another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all i know .  no offense .  hey lean over let me smell your breath .  . say in a deep voice a superhero 's job is to protect .  .  . 
you 're scaring me selina .   do it some more . 
you ca n't figure me out .  you 're the strange one .  . 
you are .  .  . 
uhhuh .  . 
i 'm not through .  this will come as a shock .  again to one of you .  i am catwoman .  the catwoman . 
fine fine at a later date i 'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who 's not the creep .  but for now i 'm drilling inside your brains .  .  . i bring up the whole catwoman thing for one reason .   i bit captain god in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses  my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender .  . 
not too cool .  .  . 
then there 's you louis sneaking through back alleys and surprise visiting me at my home .  . both of you have been way too frisky from the get go .  i 'm actually a pretty amazing personfunny smart attractive when i get my sleepbut you two had no way of knowing that when i met you both i was basically a morose depressed amnesiac incapable of any human feeling .  the only reason one of you wanted to go out with me is because you knew i was catwoman . 
okay .  let 's get serious .  of course i know the cult of good is not good .  ever since i saw what they did in atlanta it has been my mission to expose them .  i 've followed them to oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice .  that computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle .  this is n't just a story selinaanother damn pulitzerthis is my life . 
we have to do something .  what can we do to help selina ? 
i 'll let you know . 
but i 'm blind . 
it 's seeingeye dogs ma 'am .  if i let the cat stay will you go out with me ? 
what if i say i 'll go out with you so you can have all these great daydreams but then never actually talk to you again ? 
okay deal . 
i 'll go out with you .  now go get me these old newspapers .  .  . 
yes mother .  dear . 
oh i forgot to tell you you 're on a diet .  .  . the fact you 're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you . 
oh mommy you 're embarrassing me . 
is every single thing out of your mouth since your accident have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm ? 
maybe . 
it 's funny i 've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career .  and i 've heard of foregoing a career to start a family but i think you 're onto something new selina .  absolutely nothing has a ring to it .  i think it could catch on .  .  . how 's that for sarcasm ? 
pretty good .  .  . mom i do n't want you to think i do n't appreciate .  .  . letting me stay getting me the jobi 've been a mess .  i 'm still a mess .  it 's just .  .  . we have to start having a different conversation .  i ca n't take .  . 
she 'll be with you soon .   they 're pulling up .   they 'll realize i kept my part of the bargain . 
she 'll never be the same .   none of us will . 
include me in that . 
why did n't you just shoot them ? 
because a lot of people would 've gotten killed .   probably all the wrong ones . 
you 're going to let them get away with this ? 
we 've almost got your husband and your daughter out .   so do n't get any ideas . 
they tortured us .   and you 're going to let them have all that money ? 
so far they 're keeping their part of it . 
they put their hands all over me . 
somehow i got along better with you on the phone .   it 's all there is n't it ? 
hand me the phone . 
why are you telling him that .   are you crazy ? 
the rest of the money is here in the car .   why do n't you come and get it ? 
there is n't any such person . 
whose money is this ? 
it belongs to the man you took it from .   or should i saw ustoleu it from ? 
the guy with the transplant . 
jack oberfeld in person .   did you kill him ? 
damned if i know . 
the video cameras will put you with him in the bank and i 'll bet there were enough witnesses . 
at least one . 
plus they 'll remember you going after his daughter at school . 
you timed that beautifully . 
they always pick rachel up early on thursday . 
i got what i fucking deserved .   i had it all .   i could 've kept going ! 
as they say  no good deed goes unpunished . 
and all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop 
i thought it was inspired . 
there was unou cop involved .   oh shit !   fuck ! 
why pick me to be your mark ? 
nobody 's easier to con than a con man . 
you knew about me . 
l . a . p . d . 
shit .   you could n't be in much worse shape . 
there 's no way out for you .   you have to deal with us . 
assure them that you 're being well treated . 
he seems to think he 's entitled to it all . 
not all .   they already have a third .   the question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back ? 
you wo n't shoot me .   that 's not your style . 
we might hit a bump and the gun might go off .   ever see that tarantino movie  where travolta blew that guy away in the back seat  purely by accident ? 
do you have to point that ? 
absolutely .   and topanga canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if i recall . 
he seems to be headed for topanga . 
i 'm not trying to lose them .   nor am i exceeding any speed limits . 
the one thing you do n't want is to attract the police . 
granted the cops are not an alternative .   certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk . 
i do n't hear him moving around anymore . 
those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good .   that 's on their head .   all i did i was put him there . 
a typical fuckup . 
what 's that supposed to me ? 
i knew you were a loser the first night i laid eyes on you . 
you i would 've noticed . 
oh no you were too busy trying to keep some croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend .  she showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel . 
you were at the emerald that night ? 
naturally you did n't learn your lesson . 
i guess i ought to stop seeing woman as victims . 
i think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you .   and when you thought i was being kicked around i wish i could 've seen your face . 
you 're enjoying this too much . 
you could 've hit me . 
only in the leg or the thigh .  you 'd live but you just would n't wear shorts . 
you would n't 
yes i would .   not kill you .   but blow off a few toes absolutely .  i 'm entitled to that as retribution .   it 'll help you to remember me in years to come  every time you put on stockings .  they must have prosthetic toes by now  with little nails on them you can polish 
stop talking like that ! 
then scream for me .   a repeat performance .   let me see how easy you can turn it on .   scream !   i want to hear you scream for me ! 
what ? 
whatever it is she does for you . 
consider it how you like .  just get that bloody tart out of here . 
it 's a simple question . 
two hundred quid mr .  deveroux . 
your pat just cost me two hundred quid .

in a way .

guy i work with . 
what 's his name ? 
what 's it to you ? 
nothing . 
no .

shut the fuck up jude . 
that true fergus ?  you in love ? 
no we are . 
you 're crazy 
give me the fucking shooter ! 
let me know what you want  i 'll pick a suit that matches . 
did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf ? 
the shower 's in there . 
this is a ludicrous situation .  there must be dozens of men dying to use my shower . 
then i suggest you call one of them . 
i dare you . 
have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on ?   what a nut . 
shut the door ! 
i do n't think i know that one . 
how often do you go through this little ritual ? 
i do n't believe it . 
i keep thinking about charles and scobie  and the one who 's going to be next  me ? 
nothing 's going to happen to you while i 'm around  i want you to believe that . 
how can i believe it when you do n't even know who the killer is ?  i 've got that right have n't i ?  you do n't know who did it . 
no  not yet . 
but then if we sit back and wait the field should start narrowing down should n't it ?  whoever 's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination would n't you say so ? 
are you trying to say that i might have killed charles and scobie ? 
it 's a start anyway . 
i do n't understand you at all  one minute you 're chasing me around the shower room and the next you 're accusing me of murder . 
carson dyle did n't have a brother . 
i ca n't very well leave without a pair of water wings . 
okay .  then get set for the story of my life  not that it would ever make the bestseller list . 
fiction or nonfiction ? 
why do n't you shut up ! 
well ! 
are you going to listen ? 
go on . 
after i graduated college i was all set to go into my father business .  umbrella frames  that 's what he made .  it was a sensible business i suppose but i did n't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible . 
i suppose all this is leading somewhere ? 
it led me away from umbrella frames for one thing .  but that left me without any honest means of support . 
what do you mean ? 
when a man has no profession except the one he loathes what 's left ?  i began looking for people with more money than they 'd ever need  including some they 'd barely miss . 
you mean you 're a thief ? 
well it is n't exactly the term i 'd have chosen but i suppose it captures the spirit of the thing . 
i do n't believe it . 
well i ca n't really blame you  not now . 
but i do believe it  that 's what i do n't believe .  so it 's goodbye alexander dyle  welcome home peter joshua . 
sorry the name 's adam canfield . 
adam canfield .  wonderful .  do you realize you 've had three names in the past two days ?  i do n't even know who i 'm talking to any more . 
the man's the same even if the name is n't . 
no  he 's not the same .  alexander dyle was interested in clearing up his brother 's death .  adam canfield is a crook .  and with all the advantages you 've got  brains charm education a handsome face 
oh god brent is there anything you do n't feel guilty about ? 
is there anything you do ? 
focus on the present .  you always want to change the past .  let 's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today not what you should told them yesterday . 
i 'm going to tell them everything i know .  i 'm calling a town meeting for eight p . m .

no .  those two were together before kenny and i started hanging out and that 's over what god a year now . 
i want you to head right home after school . 
i will .  is that all ? 
what 's wrong ? 
i have a question to ask you .  a personal question .

so you do n't remember .  .  . 
 .  .  . selling this young man beer wednesday night . 
i do n't sell beer to minors .   i take that kinda thing .  .  . 
 .  .  . seriously . 
that 's not the way i .  .  . 
mason you would n't know the truth if it bit you .   we 've got your whole record .   we know about thethe conviction for vagrancy .  .  . 
 .  .  . public drunkenness .  .  .  . 
i did n't sell the boy any .  .  . 
 .  .  . beer . 
shut your mouth until i tell you .  .  . 
 .  .  . to talk son . 
you know i gotta tell you .   that really bothers me somebody calls me son . 
then how about if i call you ass .  .  . 
do you know where she might be ? 
certainly not ! 
he .  .  .  we did .  .  .  he would n't tell me her name .   we quarreled over her .  .  .  of course .  it came as a complete surprise to me . 
a complete surprise ? 
yes . 
but i thought you 'd hired a private investigator . 
a private investigator ? 
mr .  gittes . 
well yes . 
i do n't think so mrs .  mulwray .  of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information we 'll be in touch . 
yes that mulwray mr .  gittes .  and since you agree with me we 've never met you must also agree that i have n't hired you to do anything .  certainly not spy on my husband .  i see you like publicity mr .  gittes .  well you 're going to get it . 
now wait a minute mrs .  mulwray .  .  . 
what are you having ? 
iced tea . 
yeah .  fine thank you . 
actually he 's not .  and he 's moved from his apartment at the el macando . 
that 's not his apartment . 
anyway .  .  .  i .  .  .  the point is mrs .  mulwray .   i 'm not in business to be loved but i am in business and believe me whoever set up your husband set me up .  l . a . s a small town people talk . 
mr .  gittes you 've talked me into it .  i 'll drop the lawsuit . 
what ? 
i said i 'll drop it . 
mrs .  mulwray ? 
yes mr .  gittes ? 
i do n't want to drop it . 
why ?  .  .  .  what on earth for ?   look hollis seems to think you 're an innocent man . 
well i 've been accused of many things mrs .  mulwray but never that . 
what do you mean ? 
may i speak frankly mrs .  mulwray ? 
you may if you can mr .  gittes . 
well that little girlfriend she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course .   she 's disappeared .  maybe they disappeared together somewhere . 
suppose they did .  how does it concern you ? 
nothing personal mrs .  mulwray i just 
it 's very personal .  it could n't be more personal .  is this a business or an obsession with you ? 
look at it this way .  now this phony broad excuse the language says she 's you she 's hired me .  whoever put her up to it did n't have anything against me .  they were out to get your husband .  now if i see him i can help him .   did you talk this morning ? 
i 'm afraid not mrs .  mulwray .  these men are my operatives and at some point they 're going to assist me .  i ca n't do everything myself . 
of course not . 
now what makes you certain he is involved with someone ? 
 .  .  . yes of course . 
then go home and forget about it . 
but .  .  . 
i 'm sure he loves you too .  you know the expression let sleeping dogs lie ?  you 're better off not knowing . 
but i have to know . 
hollis .  hollis mulwray . 
water and power ? 
money does n't matter to me mr .  gittes . 
yeah .   do you have any references ? 
city of la habra heights filled an 800000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days . 
that 's swell .  but how about here ?   ever worked for robert knox emma dill clarence speer marian parsons or jasper lamar crabb ? 
never heard of em .  .  .  new owners ? 
yeah . 
lot of turnover these days .  better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land . 
yeah i 'll do that . 
he 's not in mr .  ? 
gittes . 
may i ask what this is regarding ? 
it 's personal .  has he been out long ? 
since lunch . 
gee whiz .   and i 'm late . 
he was expecting you ? 
fifteen minutes ago .  why do n't i go in and wait ? 
well i 'm on my lunch hour .  i 'll wait . 
he 's liable to be tied up indefinitely . 
i take a long lunch .  all day sometimes . 
yes .  no . 
he did or he did n't ? 
he owned it . 
yes . 
he owned the entire water supply for the city ? 
yes . 
how did they get it away from him ? 
mr .  mulwray felt the public should own the display .  the water .  if you 'll just read the display . 
mulwray ?  i thought you said cross owned the department . 
along with mr .  mulwray . 
they were partners . 
yes .  yes they were partners . 
they got into a terrific argument outside the pig n whistle . 
what about ? 
i do n't know .  the traffic was pretty loud .  i only heard one thing  apple core . 
apple core ? 
yeah . 
we certainly do .   vacation's over  starting right after dinner .   but right now  that lady over there    that 's the new society editor i take it ?   you think i could interrupt her a moment mr .  bernstein ? 
huh ?   oh i forgot  you 've been away so long i forgot about your joking 
you do n't really think so ? 
i do .   i do .   i mean since you 're running for governor  and you want to be elected   i think it 's wonderful you 're going to be elected .   only     can i say something ? 
please mr .  bernstein . 
well the way i look at it     you want to know what i really think would be wonderful ? 
well why do n't you mr .  bernstein ?  you know mr .  leland . 
i might make him nervous . 
you and leland and mr .  kane  you were great friends back in the old days i understand . 
that 's right .   they called us the three musketeers . 
that 's a long story . 
and the social .   how about the music notice ?   you got that in ? 
oh yes it 's already made up .   our mr .  mervin wrote a small review . 
enthusiastic ? 
yes very !   naturally . 
well well  is n't that nice ? 
well mr .  bernstein you were with mr .  kane from the very beginning 
from before the beginning young fellow .  and now it 's after the end .   anything you want to know about him  about the paper 
  we thought maybe if we can find out what he meant by that last word  as he was dying 
that rosebud ?   maybe some girl ?   there were a lot of them back in the early days and 
not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years on his death bed 
you 're pretty young mr .    mr .  thompson .   a fellow will remember things you would n't think he 'd remember .  you take me .   one day back in 1896 i was crossing over to jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out there was another ferry pulling in    and on it there was a girl waiting to get off .   a white dress she had on  and she was carrying a white pastrol  and i only saw her for one second and she did n't see me at all  but i 'll bet a month has n't gone by since that i have n't thought of that girl .   see what i mean ?   well so what are you doing about this rosebud mr .  thompson . 
i 'm calling on people who knew mr .  kane .  i 'm calling on you . 
who else you been to see ? 
well i went down to atlantic city 
susie ?   i called her myself the day after he died .   i thought maybe somebody ought to .  .  .   she could n't even come to the phone . 
you know why ?   she was so 
sure sure . 
i 'm going back there . 
who else did you see ? 
nobody else but i 've been through that stuff of walter thatcher 's .  that journal of his 
thatcher !   that man was the biggest darn fool i ever met 
he made an awful lot of money . 
it 's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money .   thatcher ! 
i guess mr .  kane did n't think so well of susie 's art anyway . 
he thought she was great mr .  thompson .  he really believed that .   he put all his ambition on that girl .   after she came along he never really cared for himself like he used to .   oh i do n't blame susie 
well then how could he write that roast ?   the notices in the kane papers were always very kind to her . 
oh yes .   he saw to that .   i tell you mr .  thompson he was a hard man to figure out .   he had that funny sense of humor .   and then too maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show leland he was an honest man .  you see leland did n't think so .   i guess he showed him all right .   he 's a nice fellow but he 's a dreamer .   they were always together in those early days when we just started the enquirer . 
it did n't end very well did it ? 
it ended   then there was susie  that ended too .   i guess he did n't make her very happy   you know i was thinking  that rosebud you 're trying to find out about 
yes 
maybe that was something he lost .  mr .  kane was a man that lost  almost everything he had   you ought to talk to bradford leland .  he could tell you a lot .   i wish i could tell you where leland is but i do n't know myself .   he may be out of town somewhere  he may be dead . 
in case you 'd like to know mr .  bernstein he 's at the huntington memorial hospital on 180th street . 
you do n't say !   why i had no idea 
nothing particular the matter with him they tell me .   just  
just old age .   it 's the only disease mr .  thompson you do n't look forward to being cured of .   you ought to see mr .  leland .   there 's a whole lot of things he could tell you  if he wanted to . 
who said anything about brooms ? 
it 's three hours and fifty minutes late  but we did it 
yes sir .  
lock it  and keep it locked . 
yes sir 
ca n't say sir . 
mrs .  kane liked poetry 
not my wife  not either of them . 
do you know what that is ? 
it 's a wall you bought in china mr .  kane . 
persia .   it belonged to a king . 
how did you get him to part with it mr .  kane ? 
he was dead .  .  .   that 's a poem .   do you know what it means ? 
no i do n't mr .  kane . 
i did n't used to be afraid of it . 
what makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid something inflexible that people are supposed to pay two cents for 
it 's been a tough day . 
a wasted day . 
what 're you going to do charlie ? 
people are going to know who 's responsible .   and they 're going to get the news  the true news  quickly and simply and entertainingly .   and no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news . 
it 's a good idea for a newspaper .   four hundred sixy thousand . 
shock trauma .  she 's going to need years of therapy after this .  my question is how did she come to have sex with the dead man ?

typically male point of view . 
how do you figure ? 
you show some bedroom proficiency and you think you 're gods .  what about what we do for you ? 
women ?  women as lovers are all basically the same they just have to be there . 
be there ? 
making a male climax is not all that challenging insert somewhere close and preferably moist thrust repeat . 
how flattering . 
now making a woman cum .  .  .  therein lies a challenge . 
oh you think so ? 
a girl makes a guy cum it 's standard .  a guy makes a girl cum it 's talent . 
and i actually date you ? 
something wrong ? 
i 'm insulted .  believe me don juan it takes more than that to get a guy off .  just being thereas you put itis not enough . 
i touched a nerve . 
i 'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life . 
it was n't directed at you .  i was making a broad generalization . 
you were making a generalization about broads ! 
these are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me . 
how many ? 
how many what ? 
how many girls have you slept with ? 
how many different girls ?  did n't we already have this discussion once ? 
we might have i do n't remember .  how many ? 
including you ? 
it better be up to and including me . 
twelve . 
you 've slept with twelve different girls ? 
including you yes . 
patience my love patience . 
that 's a virtue is n't it ? 
wait i think i have them sighted .   what 's the word frank ? 
just hangin' out . 
do n't say that .   you 'll embarrass frank . 
the ledge i know it well or should i say uweu know it well . 
you can stop right there . 
we spent a night there one night .  .  . 
enough . 
yeah we were caught in a storm .  i went up there an innocent climber .  .  . 
oh please . 
do n't believe it .  .  .   you know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter .  everything you think just pours right out . 
on my way .   alright sarah are you ready for the best ride in the park ? 
when you call me gabriel i know i 've got trouble . 
where 've you been ? 
working .  .  . i 'm trying to figure out where to start . 
maybe i can help .  let 's see .  .  .  if one night i got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note and stayed away for months i think what i 'd want to do is come up with a well thoughtout reason . 
after the funeral i just had to leave . 
had to leave ?   believe me we all wanted to leave .  .  . but you know what ?   we stayed . 
a lot of things fell apart up there . 
i know .  .  . 
i do n't think you do . 
why ca n't you believe that you did everything you could ? 
did i ?   i do n't know .   maybe i should n't have gone out on that line .   maybe i panicked . 
i was there you were the only one who did n't panic .   so do everyone a favor do n't hog all the guilt .   you held on as long as you could .   yes everything did go wrong starting with hal .  i mean what was he doing up on the tower with a girl who could barely climb ? 
i ca n't blame anything on hal .  it was me .   i play it back in my mind everyday . 
then turn it off gabe because it does n't get any better . 
i do n't expect you to understand . 
i do n't understand ? 
you could n't . 
you 're saying i do n't understand ?   i 'm the uonlyu one who does understand .   i 'm the one you lived with for two years i 'm the one you made promises to i 'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all .   believe me there 's been times i did n't know what i wanted to do more love you or hate you .   but the one thing in our relationship that i did know and still do know is that i uunderstand youu . 
why are you yelling ? 
excuse me ? 
why are you yelling ? 
did i miss something ? 
y 'know yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting
i 'm not going to faint but if i want to faint i 'll faint okay ? 
okay but if you do i 'll have to perform resuscitation
resuscitation ? 
mouthtomouth which could maybe .  .  . 
which could maybe what ? 
maybe lead to a flare up .  .  . 
a flare up .  .  . 
flare up of old emotions .  .  . 
listen to you .  .  .   the old mouthtomouth resuscitation routine huh ? 
from one professional to another of course . 
course maybe you do n't have to wait until i faint . 
no i think i will it 's safer .  i have patience . 
i ca n't .   not here .   if you want i 'd like you to come with me .  .  . somewhere else . 
where ? 
it does n't matter anywhere but here . 
you come back after being gone almost a year and you expect me to just leave .  .  .   this was uouru home now it 's umyu home .   i ca n't leave .   you can stay with me and believe me i want you to but to just take off for the wrong reasons i ca n't do it .   and you should n't either . 
like i said i ca n't turn it off . 
and i ca n't leave . 
if it 's alright i 'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear . 
you know where everything is .  .  .   i 'm late for my shift . 
jessyou look good . 
hal knows what he 's doing . 
he does n't want my help . 
that 's not the issue here those people are .   he ca n't do it alone . 
he can handle it .

i have n't climbed in monthsyou lose the feel .

i just do n't get this all .  it was them that went for me brothers .  you 're not on their side and ca n't be .  you ca n't be dim .  it was someone we fillied with back in the old days .  .  .  trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time .  you remember dim ?

the police .  .  .  the horrible ghastly police .  they beat me up sir .  the police beat me up sir .  mr .  alexander stares at him .  it becomes apparent he is insane . 
i know who you are !  is n't it your picture in the newspapers ?  did n't i see you this morning on the video ?  are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique ? 
yes sir that 's exactly who i am sir .  .  .  and what i am .  .  .  a victim sir .  mr .  alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses . 
then by god you have been sent here by providence .  tortured in prison then thrown out to be tortured by the police .  my heart goes out to you poor poor boy .  oh you are not the first to come here in distress .  the police are fond of bringing their victims to the outskirts of this village .  but it is providential that you who are also another kind of victim should come here .  but you 're cold and shivering .  julian draw a bath for this young man . 
good evening . 
it was very kind of you to leave this out for me sir .  there was noone around when i finished my bath so i started .  i hope that 's alright sir . 
of course .  food alright ?

wo n't you join me sir ? 
no my health does n't allow it . 
and you sir ? 
thank you sir . 
my wife .  .  .  alex freezes . 
 .  .  .  used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing . 
your wife sir ?  has she gone away ? 
no .  she 's dead ! 
i 'm sorry to hear about that sir .  his face contorted in rage . 
she was very badly raped you see .  we were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house in this very room you 're sitting in now .  i was left a helpless cripple .  the doctors said it was pneumonia because it happened some months later during the flu epidemic .  the doctors told me it was pneumonia but i knew what it was .  a victim of the modern age poor poor girl .  suddenly his mood changes .  he wheels right up to alex . 
and now you another victim of the modern age .  but you can be helped .  i phoned some friends while you were having a bath . 
phoned some friends sir ? 
yes .  they want to help . 
help me sir ? 
help you . 
who are they sir ? 
they 're very very important people and they 're interested in you .  bell rings .  julian rises
julian .  this will be these people now .  alex gets up . 
look sir .  i 'm sorry to have troubled you .  i think i ought to be going sir .  julian bars the way . 
no no my boy .  no trouble at all .  alex slowly sits . 
i 'm frightfully sorry .  there is a telephone in the public house about a mile down the road .  i suggest you use that . 
but missus this is an emergency .  it 's a matter of life and death .  me friend 's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death . 
i .  .  .  i 'm very sorry but i never open .  i 'm very sorry but i never open the door to strangers after dark . 
very well madam .  i suppose you ca n't be blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about .  alex walks away from door then ducks into the bushes where the others are hiding .  they put on their maskies and follow alex round to the rear of the house . 
what the bloody hell d 'you think you 're doing ? 
our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not shall we say satisfactory yes ? 
now listen here you little bastard just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in .  alex eyes a giant white fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him . 
naughty naughty naughty you filthy old soomaka . 
no !  no !  do n't touch it .  that 's a very important work of art .  what the bloody hell do you want ? 
you see madam i am part of an international student 's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines . 
cut the shit sonny and get out of here before you get yourself in some very serious trouble .  he rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion . 
how do you do sir ? 
hullo . 
missus .  very pleased to meet you . 
i understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the police tonight . 
yes sir .  i suppose you might call it that sir . 
hahaha and how are you feeling now ?

feel like talking to us .  answering a few questions ? 
fine sir fine . 
well as i 've said we 've heard about you .  we are interested in your case .  we want to help you . 
thank you very much sir . 
but first we 'd like to find out a few things about you . 
what would you like to know sir ? 
well shall we get down to it ? 
yes sir .  rubinstein takes out a notebook . 
i think .  .  .    .  .  . i think you should get this gun out of my fucking face . 
what ?   what did you say ? 
i said .   get the gun .   out .   of my fucking uface . u before i wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you . 
federal ? 
you tell me .   i had to toss the list in the river .   i was protecting your sorry longwinded ass .   so why do n't you show a little courtesy ? 
tell me .   has black peter already crossed off a few bad children ? 
the fat man on cherry street .   the other fat man mr .  bulldozer .   the trumpet player .   that leaves two . 
can you finish on schedule ? 
in fifteen years i have never left a customer unsatisfied . 
would n't dream of it . 
twenty five ? 
hell make it fifty .   same goes for any business we have in the future . 
very generous . 
by the way .   daniel said he was sorry . 
pretty quiet down there .   a cab just pulled up aside from that .  .  . 
 .  .  . petrov and cicerno for sure .  .  . 
can you fax me his picture ?   his license or something ?   what do you mean you do n't have that there ?   anybody else in the cab ? 
so ? 
 .  .  . so his description of max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of villa rodeo .   that guy ?   that guy is a cabbie .   and you 're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater assassin with heavy trigger time ?  what 's he do squeeze em in between fares ? 
no .   your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab . 
i do n't know .  .  . 
makes two of us . 
tribeca near the waterfront northeast corner .   twelve minutes . 
you do impress me max .   that you do . 
who ? 
your lady friend .   the one who gave you her business card .   think she was just being polite ? 
i do n't know . 
what holds you back max ?   tell me .  why does life scare you so much ? 
i only owe you a ride vincent . 
it 's not what you owe ume . u time is so fleeting .   one day it 's gone .   you make it out of this alive max you really should call her .   that 's what i think . 
you had to kill heller ?  ! 
who 's heller ? 
that cop !   why 'd you have to do that ?   you could n't wound him ?   the guy had a family maybe parents kids who gotta grow up without a dad he was probably a good guy and he believed me .  .  . 
i shoulda saved him cause he ubelievedu you ? 
no not just that . 
yeah that . 
yeah so what 's wrong with that ? 
it 's what i do for a living .

and you believe me .  .  .  ? 
what 'd they do ? 
how do i know ?   but they all got that witnesses for the prosecution look to me .   probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted .  .  .   i dunno . 
that 's the reason ? 
that 's the why .   that 's the why ?  there is no reason .   no good reason no bad reason .   to live or to die . 
then what are you ? 
 .  .  . indifferent . 
what happened to you ? 
as in .  .  .  ?  
man if someone had a gun to your head and said  you gotta tell me what 's goin' on with that person over there or i 'll kill you .  .  . they 'd have to kill you .  .  .   cause you do n't have a clue for .  .  . or about .  .  . anyone .  .  .   to be like that i do n't think you you have any of that for your own life .  .  .   do you believe you 're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a . m .  ?   open your eyes in the morning ?   i do n't think you do .  .  . i do n't think so .  .  .   i think you are way ulowu .  .  . like in your estimation .   in your estimation of yourself .   so how 'd you get that way .  .  .  ? 
 .  .  . all the cabbies in la i pull max the man with xray vision .  .  . 
answer the question . 
look in the mirror .    .  .  . pissant paper towels .  .  . a bottle of 409 .  .  . saving up for goin' to the comoros .   how much you got saved ? 
none of your business . 
 .  .  . pie in the sky ?   someday my dream 'll come .  .  .   but one night you 'll wake up and realize suddenly you 're old .   it has n't happened .   it never will .   life just flipped on you .   tomorrow became yesterday .   then you 'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen anyway and push it back in memory .  .  . and anesthetize yourself in a barcalounger with daytime tv for the rest of your life .  .  .   do n't talk to me about murder .   you 're udoinu' yourself .  .  . in this yellow prison with steelbelted radials .  clocking in and out everyday .  .  . 
slow down . 
i should have done that .   fixed it and more .   get out from under what i been under .  .  . 
but you know what ?   nothing matters anyway .   we are insignificant out here in the big nowhere say the badass sociopath in my backseat .   right ?  yeah .   that 's one thing i 've got to thank you for bro .   and i never saw it that way .  .  . 
what are you gonna do pull the trigger ?   kill us ?   go ahead man !  ushootu .  .  . my ass . 
slow down ! 
vincent ? 
was your seatbelt fastened honey ? 
let her go . 
yes you do jerry .   quite well . 
that 's great .   good for you . 
who have you been talking to jerry ?   who else knows what you know ? 
could you be a little more specific ? 
lysergic acid diethylamide .  .  .  with a little kicker of my own .   surely it must be coming back to you by now ? 
ulizau ! 
you should n't watch jerry .   it 's a moment without hope . 
you 've never seen her run . 
then i ca n't be hurt anymore . 
you 're welcome .   where 's my partner ? 
i like that .   a gun to your head and you ask about your partner .  he 's okay .   may have a headache for a few days .   are you here with honorable intentions ? 
i 'm not sure what you mean . 
you should think of me as liza sutton's guardian angel . 
that 's ironic .   because we 're here to protect her from you . 
you 're here because you figured i might show up . 
it seemed like a possibility .  what about your intentions ?   are they honorable ? 
i 'm not a violent man mr .  lowry .  not by nature anyhow .   but if you hurt liza in any way i 'll kill you .   does that seem honorable ? 
well i do n't know if 
i 'm leaning toward no . 
that 's your option .   ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time .   in case you did n't know it you 're crazy . 
we got someone watching her 24 hours a day .   she 
that 's not what i mean .   i want to see her . 
i do n't know .  .  . 
then screw you .   i 'll rot . 
alright .   you can see her .   but she ca n't see you . 
whatever . 
a dog bit it . 
excuse me ? 
you were going to ask about my nose .   the poor animal is slated to be destroyed today . 
and you feel bad for it ? 
it was my dog .   let me ask you a question .   how long have you been acquainted with jerry ? 
you already asked me that .   why do you insist on making me repeat myself ? 
and you have no idea where he lives ? 
you 've asked me that one three times . 
here 's a fresh one .   why you ?  your colleague mr .  wilson says jerry wo n't speak to anyone else .  that seems oddly possessive behavior to me . 
i 'm sorry .   what was the question again ? 
uwhy youu ? 
honestly ?   i think he has a crush on me . 
a charming term .   now uwhy himu ? 
excuse me ? 
jerry 's visits to your office .  why do you tolerate them ?   why him ? 
a year ago i was leaving work late one night .   two guys tried to mug me .   it was horrible .   jerry came out of nowhere .   to my rescue .  then he started coming to see me .   could 've been a storybook if he was n't crazy .   at first i did my beat to avoid him .   but there 's something inside jerry and .  .  .   jerry made me see it .   uhe made meu usee himu .   that make sense ? 
because i ca n't . 
i ca n't move any smaller . 
try again between the static and hey jude' that 's where they 're hiding . 
but what do i say ? 
just be yourself captain .   find out where he is . 
on that old shortwave ?   maybe on a clear night .   come on now under the covers . 
could we hear to the moon ? 
big enough radio i do n't see why not . 
could we hear god ? 
mmm that 's a good one .   maybe his echo .  .  .   okay no more stalling . 
okay okay .  .  .  there . 
that 's a beauty captain .   now get some sleep . 
okay . 
i 'm sorry i could n't be there for you sweetheart . 
dad .  .  .  but tell me how did .  .  .  i mean how can .  .  .  ? 
that 's my scientist . 
so .   are you an hallucination ?   or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin ? 
am i artifact or dream ?   you might ask that about anything . 
but you 're so .  .  .  i mean how could you possibly .  .  .  ?   when i was unconscious .   you .  .  .  downloaded .  .  .  my thoughts my memories even .  .  .   this beach .   i 've never been here but i remember .  .  .  it 's how i always imagined .  .  .   pensacola . 
we thought this might make things a little easier . 
originally just another species like yourselves .   well not like you at all actually but .  .  . 
can you show me ? 
small moves captain small moves . 
why did you contact us ? 
you contacted us .   we were simply listening .   we 've been listening for millions of years . 
and those other docking ports i saw .  .  .  i mean .  .  .  there are others ? 
many others . 
and they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built . 
oh we did n't build it .   the transit system has been in place for billions of years we 're just its .  .  .  caretakers . 
so who .  .  .  ? 
we do n't know .   whoever they were they were gone long before we ever got here . 
the scale .  .  .  it 's just .  .  .   so all the civilizations you detect they all end up coming here ? 
not all .   some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams .   some never make it this far . 
so we passed some kind of test ? 
you have your mother 's hands .  .  .   there are no tests ellie .   we do n't sit in judgment .   think of us more as .  .  .  librarians .   curators of the universe 's rarest and most valuable creation .  .  . 
can you help us ? 
yeah they sure do make a lot of cold hard noise captain . 
fasten your flap !  all you newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang .  we got rules here an' in order to learn them you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut .

without question ?   he only scored 40 percent four out of ten criteria ?   could n't another expert say he uflunkedu the sexual sadist test ?   what curve are you marking on doctor ? 
the test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects . 
only part .   what else ?   what did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because joan of arc told him to do it . 
he was lying . 
'lying .   he was lying .  i asked you what you thought not what he did . 
i thought he was lying . 
you said first he was lying .   how do you know that doctor ? 
because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears .   daryll lee told me that joan of arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear . 
what pattern was that ? 
the same as the first time .  .  . 
what first two murders .   we do n't know about them here do we ? 
he told me he had done two others just like it . 
when was that ? 
when he was seventeen .

i got worried .  are you ok ? 
i know they wo n't be home tonight . 
if you think because you 're a women this ca n't go hard on you think again . 
laurant and vincent were in business with zammito . 
what kind of business ? 
black market art .  zammito got to a few key security guards at the metropolitan museum .  the bastaldi 's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works .  they 'd switch the paintings send the originals to paris and the bastaldi 's would sell them to private collectors . 
you 're always pointing out my negative qualities .  my analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people . 
no problem . 
we ca n't . 
i agree with marcel .  i say we go to the airport and get on a plane . 
we 're leaving .  raymond get the bag . 
she probably hid it at her place .     the six of us could find it in 
too risky .  we do n't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car . 
why do i always have to answer the phone ? 
because you 're the closest . 
i 'm not any closer than you are . 
get in the car . 
just tell me who 's closer to the wall ? 
they sort of got away . 
i see .  well get back out on the street and find them before i sort of kill you . 
yeah .    it 's mine . 
no .    it 's mine . 
the hell it is . 
i 'm telling you that 's my car !    and someone 's gonna pay for it ! 
and i 'm tellin' you it ai n't !  now turn your tacoeating ass around and get the hell out of here . 
fuck you greaseball ! 
fuck me ?    fuck you ! 
uh huh . 
i represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother . 
i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
i understand .  the person who sent me wishes to help you . 
how ? 
you see that car ? 
it 's yours .  a gift .  a gift you could give to your brother .  .  .  or anyone you owe money to as partial payment . 
no shit ? 
the papers for the car will arrive tomorrow . 
no problem man .   hey you wanna hit ? 
no thank you . 
yeah i dig him . 
although a cartoon i feel he shares a universal theme we are all searching for love .  no ? 
i know where she went . 
cool . 
feel free to correct him if you want . 
all right .   i 'll write you an introduction .   take it to wudan .  wait there for news from me . 
not everything is an illusion .   my hand .  .  .  was n't that real ? 
your hand rough and callused from machete practice .  .  .  all this time i 've never had the courage to touch it . 
to repress one 's feelings only makes them stronger . 
you 're right but i do n't know what to do .   i want to be with you .  .  .  just like this .   it gives me a sense of peace . 
what about you ? 
i 'll look around and catch up later . 
not a bad idea .   tonight we 'll get a good night 's sleep at headquarters . 
jade fox drugged her .   how did you get here ? 
we followed jade fox . 
that ca n't be !   everything has an antithesis !   why not this ? 
shu lien .  .  . 
save your strength . 
my life is departing .   i 've only one breath left . 
use it to meditate .   free yourself from this world as you have been taught .   let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath .   do not waste it .  .  .  for me . 
i 've already wasted my whole life .  i want to tell you with my last breath .  .  .  i have always loved you .  i would rather be a ghost drifting by your side .  .  .  as a condemned soul .  .  .  than enter heaven without you .   because of your love .  .  .  i will never be a lonely spirit . 
i 'm sorry she 's not feeling well enough to receive you today . 
i heard sir te lost something .   and now madame te 's not feeling well .  .  . 
that 's good .   sometimes the help ca n't keep their hands to themselves .  it 's very embarassing . 
sir te knows that even wellmeaning people can make mistakes .  .  .  that can bring ruin to themselves and their families . 
but do n't be too lenient . 
no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking . 
a murderer ? 
yes .   the very killer of li mu bai 's own master .   last night she killed a policeman who had tracked her down . 
a female criminal !   now that 's news ! 
i doubt it .   this thief .  .  .  it very unusual .  .  . 
bad news .   alot of action on the streets tonight and nobody bothered to clear it with me .   tin tin got himself whacked . 
who got himself what ? 
one of mine .   and it was n't a standard hit . 
i had heard something like this .   describe it for me .   the hit . 
i was wondering if you could tell me anything .  .  .  about a wildcat operative . 
i know of no one .   but even if there is i am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with ? 
anybody violates my turf  our turf  i 'll rip out there heart and show it to em . 
to be sure .   now tell how your friend died . 
our crow .  .  .  ? 
come now .   you 've seen the graffiti  all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims .  what about your turf top ?   you do n't seem to have ripped out anyone 's heart yet . 
the night is young . 
nice speech .   what 's it supposed to mean ? 
your comprehension is not required .   your cooperation and indeed your ability are the issues on the table . 
annette harrison . 
i do n't think so . 
did you know sebastian well ? 
you might say that . 
now i remember .  annette harrison .  your father 's the new headmaster at oakwood . 
that 's right . 
i 'm sure you 're going to love it there . 
i 'll be fine . 
well i 'll leave you alone now .  i just came in here to get something of mine . 
look i know this sounds corny but whenever i feel like i ca n't go on i .  .  .   turn to jesus and he helps me through the problem .  call me an anachronism but 
oh cut the shit kathryn . 
excuse me ? 
you heard me . 
who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me .  my brother is dead have some respect . 
kathryn i know all about you and sebastian . 
sebastian was a pathological liar .  i would n't believe a word he 
i have his journal . 
you what ? 
his journal .  he sent it to me the day before he died .  everything about you is in it .  the blow jobs the hand jobs the menages your bout with bulimia the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you .  .  .  eww .  let 's see then there 's your coke problem .  .  .  you still keep it in your crucifix do n't you ?  it 's all in there . 
you did n't show it to anybody ? 
actually i was planning on running down to kinkos .  do you think you could give me ride ? 
you ca n't do this to me .  it could ruin me . 
i know . 
really ?  i thought he said it all the time . 
that 's not his style .  one thing i can say about valmont .  he always speaks the truth . 
is there a mutual feeling between you two ? 
no .  i mean .  i do n't know .   what else do you know about him ? 
not a whole lot .  we take some classes together .  he 's got a bad rep but it 's mostly bullshit . 
what do you mean ? 
well a lot of people are jealous cause he 's loaded . 
i do n't know .  i 've been hearing some awful things about him . 
from who ? 
i ca n't tell you .  i 'm sworn to secrecy . 
forever . 
now it 's my job to look out for you .  you 're like a kid sister to me .  do i look like some kind of gossip queen ? 
i told you to lock the door . 
please do n't tell anyone .  this could ruin my career . 
your career ?  what about your family ?  can you imagine the humiliation your father 's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge packer . 
come on greg .  you 're the only one who knows her .  the truth will save you . 
i swear on my life i never said a word to her about you . 
did you do everything i asked you to ? 
yes . 
you told her i never said i love you before ? 
yes ! 
you told her that people are jealous cause i 'm loaded ? 
yes ! 
and you think she bought it ? 
i 'm pretty sure she did . 
pretty sure or sure sure ? 
she bought it . 
i 'll be in touch . 
who is this ? 
sebastian you faggot .  is she with you ? 
no . 
where is she ?  ! 
i do n't know .  why do n't you leave her alone . 
mcconnell i 'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you do n't tell me where she is . 
i told you i do n't know . 
one . 
alright .  she 's staying with some friends of her parents .  the o 'sheas .  she caught the train twenty minutes ago into grand central . 
grand central .  you better not be fucking with me cause it 's your ass on the line . 
likewise i 'm sure . 
but i ca n't even see her .  she does n't have her own phone i do n't even know her email address . 
ronald ? 
yeah ? 
it 's kathryn . 
no . 
it 's sebastian .  he 's out of his mind . 
what do you mean ? 
i think he 's high on drugs .  he hit me then took off .  i 'm afraid to be alone .  please come over . 
i 'll be right there . 
would n't it be just the same darling if daddy dropped the present at mrs .  farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning ? 
but it wo n't be christmas tomorrow . 
all right amy .   go tell edward to take you . 
i wonder if you do n't resent that in her ? 
i 'm sure i do n't alice .   it 's something else  something moody  something sickly   she could almost be irena 's child . 
she 's not irena 's child  there 's nothing of irena in her .  she 's my child . 
i 'm not a jealous woman oliver . 
i know that . 
that 's why i can tell you straight out you think too much about irena  blame yourself for her death .   and its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about amy . 
no .   it 's not that .   it 's because i know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves  imagine things .  i love amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals .  i saw what happened to irena with her cat people . 
i know dear .   i understand .  but try to worry a little less about her  be a little easier in your thinking .   and especially today  let 's forget about it .  we want a really bangup birthday party do n't we ? 
you make me sound like the father in east lynne . 
darling no father could be nicer to a child than you are to amy . 
i forgot i had it on . 
it 's early yet . 
it 's nearly a quarter after four .  the party was for four was n't it ? 
yes darling
gosh in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them
times have changed . 
no kids yet .   something 's gone wrong .  maybe i ought to call somebody . 
all right ollie .   go ahead .  call the boyds .  .  . 3000w .  .  . see if their darling donald has left . 
i think i should .   3000w ? 
that 's right . 
what do you mean ? 
i called not only the boyds but the irvings .   neither of them received invitations . 
but they must have .   amy and i made them out together .   you mailed them did n't you edward ? 
amy 's been lying again . 
well it seemed to me 
you mean you did n't .  it seems to me the least you could do .  you ca n't just jump at conclusions that way .  you 're being unfair . 
i 'm never unfair . 
you 're shouting at me . 
i 'm not shouting at you but there 's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child ! 
that 's because she made a promise and she 'a keeping it are n't you darling .   you saw the way she played this afternoon edward . 
indeed i did .  up and down the garden she went laughing and singing to herself . 
good heavens !  what could you be giving me .  little miss ? 
something to do with a butterfly they were quarreling about it . 
no .  amy slapped donald because he had hurt the butterfly  and it was her friend . 
well that seems a harmless fancy 
amy has too many fancies  too few friends .  it worries me .  it does n't seem normal . 
we 'll see that she gets there in good time
but do n't you see .  .  . it 's just what i was about to say to alice .  .  . amy in her own mind may not be lying . 
but there was nothing no one in the garden . 
she needed a companion so out of her own hunger she created one .  in her mind her friend was in the garden .  in her mind her friend never leaves her .  right this very minute i 'm sure she 's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind . 
perhaps she 's wanted for understanding . 
that many women in one place  nothing good can come from that . 
sorry about frida .  she 's been friends with jen forever . 
what 's with her ?  if they 're not bleeding they 're pmsing .  if they 're not pmsing they 're warning you about the impending doom .  if you 're lucky you get a sane person one week a month .  then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life . 
i do n't believe in pms .  women made it up just so they can be bitchy . 
my brother has an answer to pms .  ass abundant sperm syndrome .  a man gets sperm buildup and if his woman is n't givin' it to em he 's gotta get it elsewhere . 
yeah and when your woman says you 're an ass say yes i have abundant sperm syndrome . 
can we get some service here ? 
jennifer gave her a makeover . 
looks like a helluva lot more than a makeover .  was there surgery involved ? 
uh .  .  .  yes .  not for us .  no woman in jeopardy .  find me dr .  quinn medicine woman .  find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women . 
no . 
no ? 
no .  i quit .  take your lame ass ideas your fake ass toupee your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them . 
very well then .  is that all ? 
we .  .  .  he walked me home and .  .  .  we said goodnight .  um he kissed me goodnight and that was it . 
okay if you think of anything else please give us a call . 
are you following me ? 
no .  .  .  no .  .  .  this is embarrassing .  i was returning your pillowcase .  .  .  and i saw you cross the street .  .  .  and i sort of started following you .  i just find you really intriguing .  i do n't know why . 
intriguing ? 
at least let me give you this back .  i washed it . 
that 's my ex .  he 's an asshole .  in case you could n't tell .  i think he 's been following me . 
there 's a lot of that going around . 
i 'm trying to stay away from caffeine . 
some decaf then ?  that was stupid .  obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off . 
no .  really .  i do n't drink coffee anymore .  i used to love it but my tastes have changed recently . 
okay well .  maybe some other time .  they continue walking together . 
so what book did you buy ? 
oh it 's nothing . 
no really i love knowing what people read . 
it 's stupid . 
i can forgive you a bestseller . 
used to ?  did it stop finally ? 
no she died when i was twelve . 
i 'm sorry . 
i 've had time to get over it .  she was killed by wolves they think . 
oh my god by wolves ? 
i 'm so sorry peter .  gee that sure puts my problems in perspective . 
the weird thing is i 've had an odd morbid fascination with wolves ever since . 
sometimes it 's frustrating .  like this gregory jameson case .  we do n't even know what killed him .  i 'm putting together little details to see if we 're missing something . 
like what ? 
you know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you 're in an accident ?  well this guy was n't wearing any underwear . 
a lot of people do n't wear underwear . 
yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line . 
yes .   this way . 
germs sir .   these places are full of them . 
i see .   one things for sure hes ambitious .  youll be a busy man from now on . 
thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing .   anyway he isnt with us any longer .   the case is yours .   go through his files .  take what you need .   by the way hows your mother ? 
shes getting better thanks .   she .  .  . 
a hunch .   he might be able to .  .  . 
ill be the judge of that .   anything else ? 
actually i was wondering sir if you could let me have a few uniforms to follow up for me .  .  . 
what makes you think that !   if you would learn to concentrate on facts not get so sidetracked    you might get things done faster bumstead .  .  . 
i see .  .  . 
how could you have been so stupid ? 
yes sir . 
sorry sir . 
dont ever sneak up on me like that !  who are you ? 
patricia crenshaw . 
couple of days .   anyhow look at these tracking polls they 'll burn up in your hands seventy three percent with seniors eighty four with working mothers .  .  . 
alan we still have to control this guy .  .  . 
and look at this .   russell came around on the trade bill . 
you 're kidding . 
how long have you been waiting to pass that thing ? 
three years . 
i 'm telling you bob  it 's a gift .  when you got a ferrari you do n't leave it in the garage . 
dave these things get awfully complicated sometimes .  .  . 
hundredth cabinet meeting .   i thought it was a nice touch . 
oh .   fine . 
i do n't think so . 
i 'm going to kill him . 
you ca n't kill a president . 
bob .  .  . 
i can kill a hundred ordinary people . 
he 's only doing what you told him to . 
what i told him to ? 
i heard you .   you said cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget and you can keep your homeless shelter . '
well i did n't mean it alan .  why the fuck would i want to save a homeless shelter ? 
he was only doing his job . 
bob .  .  . 
was he a senator ?  is he on the trilateral commission ?  was he in who 's who in washington nine years reed wrestles him away from the door as bob struggles to get free .   i 'll destroy him alan .  i 'll shred the bastard !  !  ! 
do n't do this . 
i 'll lock him away for good . 
then we 'll all go to jail together . 
just what you think i mean . 
are you threatening me ? 
sort of .  .  .  yeah . 
 .  .  .  but as i began to investigate i realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher .  .  . 
jesus .  .  . 
dave  i 'm working . 
oh yeah .  .  .  me too .   you want to get dinner later ? 
i was gonna do something with joan . 
oh .  okay .   i 'll catch ya tomorrow then . 
yeah well .  .  .  it 's finally over . 
i know . 
i missed .  .  . 
 .  .  .  me too . 
 .  .  .  not exactly the oval office . 
oh .  .  .  i lived with a president .   it is n't any fun . 
yeah .  .  .  it could be fun . 
dammit .  .  .   i told them no mayo .   see   i could veto this simpson garner thing but i really do n't want to do that .  .  . 
uh yes sir .   the monroe hotel .  .  . 
we 're working on it . 
try to find someone who looks like me this time .   that last guy was a joke . 
we 're doing our best sir . 
what about the intro ? 
it 'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech . 
it better be .    last time you had me introduce a dead guy . 
father mclntire .    he blessed you at the inauguration . 
oh yeah .   did you take care of later on ? 
all set . 
fabulous . 
maybe .  we 'll have a little talk first .  then .  .  .  . maybe .  .  . i can help you out .  string him up . 
miss it ?   it drives us crazy .   that 's part of what this club is about .   in fact i 'd like to announce that i 've published an article in the school paper in the name of the dead poets society demanding girls be admitted to welton so we can all stop beating off . 
and are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say ?   if all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other what the hell are we doing ? 
i think you 're sweet . 
what ? 
every guy that i meet wants me for one thing my body .   you 're not like that . 
i 'm not ? 
no !   anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you 're after my soul .  make me up some more poetry . 
but .  .  . 
please !     it 's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind ! 
all right !   i 'm thinking !   let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove . 
o no it is an everfixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken it is the star to every wandering bark whose worth 's unknown although his height be taken . 
this is better than sex any day .   this is romance ! 
doing fine sir . 
your family move into that new house mr .  overstreet ? 
good .   we 're very excited about him .   he was a rhodes scholar you know . 
what ?  ! 
no one sir .   it was just me .   i did the proofing so i inserted my article in place of rob crane 's . 
mr .  dalton if you think you 're the first to try to get thrown out of this school think again .   others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail .   bend over and grab your shins . 
what is that supposed to mean ? 
being in the club means being stirred up by things .   you look about as stirred up as a cesspool . 
you want me out .  .  .   is that what you 're saying ? 
no i want you in .   but being in means you gotta do something .   not just say you 're in . 
listen neil i appreciate your interest in me but i 'm not like you .   when you say things people pay attention .   people follow you .   i 'm not like that . 
why not ?   do n't you think you could be ? 
no !   i do n't know  i 'll probably never know .   the point is there 's nothing you can do about it so butt out all right ?  i can take care of myself just fine .   all right ? 
er  no . 
no ?   what do you mean no' ? 
no . 
sssh .   that 's what i 'm taking care of .  they need a letter of permission . 
from you ? 
from my father and nolan . 
neil you 're not gonna .  .  .

it 's my birthday . 
it is ?   happy birthday .   you get anything ? 
they gave me the exact same thing as last year ! 
oh .  . 
oh .  
maybe they do n't think at all unless it 's about my brother !   his birthday 's always a big todo .   the stupid thing is i did n't even like the first one . 
what ? 
i mean this is one special gift !   who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one ! 
yeah !   and just look at this ruler ! 
i will be with thee straight . 
follow me then to plainer ground .   god i love this !

so he 's got a thing for prison clothes . 
that 's just it .   he never did time .  seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another .   judge threw out the cases each time .   either he 's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends .

who is it ? 
it 's tom sharp and two other fellers  oh glory  where 's my pants ?

we can still use my butter money . 
your butter money ?

mary  it 's gone . 
not all of it ? 
yes  i had to pay the vet in full .  he just would n't have treated the horse this time .  after all we ca n't very well do without a horse . 
it 's all right jabez .  we 'll find something to pay stevens . 
if the pig had n't broke his leg we could have taken him . 
jabez !  could n't you take a sack of seed instead ? 
to save us work on the spring plowing ? 
you always said the field uphill needs a rest but if you think 
mary i 'm a farmer  always will be .  to me seed is n't a thing to pay debts with it 's alive more alive than anything  but i guess you 're right .  we just got to do it .  oh  how 's it all going to end ? 
jabez  you ought to talk to tom about joining the grange . 
i will mary  always thought a man could be stronger alone  seems i 've been wrong about that . 
seed alone wo n't do mary .  we have to throw the calf in . 
oh jabez !  and we were counting on  .  .  .   it 's a lovely calf . 
you 're right mary it 's a fine calf .  that 's why stevens 'll take it for the rest of the payment . 
jabez  .  .  . 
mary  how do you feel ? 
no jabez  all i need is some rest  you go and pay our debt .  everything 'll be all right then  .  .  .  everything .

no !   no !   do n't radio anybody just give me the fucking jeep ! 
looking for the fossils .   why should we wait until we 're in london ?   this girl was probably twelve years old . 
you should n't go into another man's tent .  it 's inexcusable . 
her hands and feet were tied . 
what did you do ? 
i looked at them .   they 're shrubs small trees .   exquisite .   and fossilized rock hard .  he walks away to the nose of the plane . 
i was talking about the girl . 
cut the ropes .   i left a note on his blanket .   at the next geographical society i shall await with great interest the announcement of the fenelonbarnes slave knot .   the girl would n't leave of course .   her father had sold her for a camel .  he turns over the propeller the engine cranks up . 
of course .   when ? 
i mean home .   india . 
kip i 
i know  here i am always a brown man there you would be always a white woman . 
is that what you think ?   is that what you think i think ? 
it 's what i 've learned . 
i 'm thinking about your heart not your skin .   and how to reach it .  and that i do n't think i can .   a bomb has ruined us just not the bomb i thought would ruin us . 
then come with me . 
i 'll always go back to that church . 
so one day we 'll meet . 
it 's not over everywhere .   i did n't mean literally . 
when he dies i 'll catch up . 
i need morphine .   a lot .   and a pistol . 
and what if he really is a spy ? 
he ca n't even move . 
if anything happened to you i 'd never forgive myself . 
he 's from there  edge of lake ontario right soldier ? 
does he know a captain mcgann ?  the boy hears this whispers to oliver . 
no .   he 's  no . 
oh god .   oh god . 
hello miss . 
i was going to say  if you want to eat with us ever you and lieutenant singh
very kind of you we can always eat in the town with the others 
since caravaggio turned up  food seems to appear so please . 
i 'll ask the lieutenant .   but thank you . 
you saved my life .   i have n't forgotten .   i thought you were very very tall .  you seemed to big  a giant  and i felt like a child who ca n't keep her balance . 
a toddler
he 's sleeping . 
only we have to go to work . 
i 'll tell him .   what is it ?   is it a mine ? 
a bomb .   at the viaduct .  she closes the door then reappears . 
does he have to go ? 
pardon me ? 
what if you could n't find him ?   sergeant not today please .  not this morning . 
that 's because i wanted them to ! 
i wondered who 'd been giving me a bad name . 
i drilled the bolts and went in through the window .  it was the only way to bypass the smart glass . 
true enough . 
you need a partner for this job .  you 'll never find one as good as me . 
it was perfect . 
you 're too easily impressed with yourself .  i believe i 've made that point before . 
no one uneedsu anything except food and shelter .  the rest we just want . 
this is n't a good time to hear your personal philosophy . 
no .  it 's a down payment . 
we get the mask i 'll tell you . 
a partner with secrets is n't much of a partner . 
without the mask it does n't matter . 
so the mask is part of the down payment too .  must be a really big job . 
let 's just see how we do . 
oh i think you can do it .  probably . 
we are .  .  . for the tools . 
try laps .  say a hundred . 
our equipment has arrived . 
hmmm . 
had to get a liquid plasma screen . 
the key to success is using the right tools . 
you 're not the one trying to get all this shit .  you think they 've just got a crooks r us on every corner ? 
we 're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust .  the air filters might be wired .  and a bypass hose for the ac . 
sure would n't want you to be uncomfortable . 
if we do n't bypass it the temperature in the mask room will change and set off the alarm .  that would be inconvenient . 
inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days . 
you are a miracle worker . 
this is big enough . 
it 's never big enough . 
it 's a death mask .  death mask means dead . 
because i never assume anything . 
i need you to get one more thing for me .  a dress elegant but sexy something grace kelly would wear .  maybe a balenciaga . 
that 's it i sure as hell ai n't no personal shopper . 
black of course . 
this better be worth 1t . 
it better be worth it for me . 
how the hell i 'm supposed to know the damn difference ? 
you look like george washington . 
i cannot tell you a goddamned lie .  she 's selling you a pig in a poke .  we better do this tonight . 
it 's too soon . 
the early bird gets the damn worm . 
but the second mouse gets the cheese . 
remind me why . 
because it pays off . 
we 're supposed to . 
you better not be taking on a new partner . 
suspicious after all these years ? 
you change partners you change the rules . 
you damn well thought wrong . 
i 'm terribly sorry old man . 
well good ed .   i like working with you too . 
from their tone of voice on the phone i 'd say they 're taking us more seriously . 
yeah i heard that one before . 
they 're trying to intimidate us .   tell them to wait in the conference room . 
d 'you get his name ?   course not .   jesus ed 
he said he 'd be at the gas station at six . 
boy this job takes me to some of the best damn places huh ? 
what ?   who ? 
some guy in a truck  he waited till i was alone then he followed me like two miles .  jesus i 'm shaking .   get me a beer . 
i do n't know .   big .   dark . 
he 's gone .   did you get a license plate ?   or a make ? 
no ed  what with me running for my life i did n't have time to check those things 
i was just asking .   are you all right ? 
yeah .   yeah i 'm  .  .  .  fine . 
i 'm sorry i 'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here   do you mind ? 
yeah i mind .   you bet your ass i mind . 
it 's my paycheck .   which i earned .   which i deserve .   which i should n't have to beg for .  that fatass bitch wo n't give it to me . 
erin you 're a big girl .   if you got a problem with jane work it out for yourself .  i do n't have time to deal with 
fuck you .   make time .   cause i bust my ass for you .   i watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet for you .   and what do you do for me ?   huh ?   you see the way i 'm treated around here  but have you ever stood up for me once ?   have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work i 'm doing ?   have you ever bothered saying hey erin does n't get paid the most cause she has the best tits she gets paid the most cause she 's the best god damn employee i 've ever had ? 
is that what you want ? 
i want my paycheck .   by the end of the day . 
you might want to think real hard about the amount too .   my kids are sitting in the god damn parking lot right now cause i still do n't make enough to afford good child care .  makes me think about looking around for a job where i 'm appreciated for shit 's sake . 
things like the head counsel for pge calling me with an offer .   20 million plus attorney 's fees .   take it or leave it . 
whoa .   no shit . 
it 's about 50 thousand per plaintiff . 
so what are you thinking ? 
i 'm thinking  .  .  .  i wish someone else had to make this decision .   50 thousand bucks is more than any other california toxic plaintiff has gotten .  ever .   but  .  .  . 
 .  .  .  but it wo n't cover annabelle daniels 's medical bills . 
and it 's less than pocket change for pge . 
do you think we 'd do better by going to trial ? 
maybe .   but maybe not .   we still do n't have anything linking this to pge corporate .  plus there 's the statute problem .   plus we 're way short on manpower so we 'd need to bring on more lawyers  .  .  . 
plus 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money . 
it 's eight million dollars erin .   eight million dollars . 
hi .   it 's me .   i got a favor to ask you . 
i do n't do favors for you anymore . 
it 's not for me it 's for my kids .   you 're the only one i trust them with . 
hunhuh .   not yet .   look do n't take any of em on your bike okay ?   call a cab if you wanna go somewhere . 
i do n't know .   few days .   thanks for helping me .   i appreciate it . 
yeah well  good help is hard to find . 
you know me .   i pick things up real fast . 
yeah but i 'm gonna get better .   a lot of these folks are n't . 
real early .   we 're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast . 
we 'll just be a minute .   get a little more sleep . 
i will .   bye . 
that 's okay .   i understand . 
it 's just  the pain .   it 's only getting worse .   i ca n't be a good wife .   i ca n't be a good mother . 
i 'm real sorry laura . 
probably an asteroid field  .  .  .  . 
let 's hope so  .  .  .  it 's just the chance we need . 
to get killed  .  .  .  you 're not seriously going into an asteroid field ? 
are n't i ?   hang on sweetheart .  we 're gonna do some flyin' . 
i take it back . 
that star destroyer is slowing down . 
good . 
i 'm against that . 
we 've got to get out of this shower . 
now you 're making sense . 
right .   i 'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones  .  .  . 
what is it ? 
that should do nicely . 
very funny .   you can let go now  .  .  .  .  i 'm getting angry . 
you do n't look angry . 
how do i look ? 
beautiful . 
well i hope you do n't expect more . 
i do n't expect anything except to be left alone . 
fine with me .   but i 'm afraid you 'll have to let go . 
felt like a hydro concussion  .  .  .  an imperial cruiser . 
they 're just trying to see if they can stir something up  .  .  .  we 're safe . 
where have i heard that before ? 
would you please stop calling me that ? 
yes you do . 
you could be a touch warmer though .   admit it against your better judgment you think i 'm all right . 
free your mind and return he will . 
my mind fills with so many images . 
control control you must learn of what you see .   not easy not fast . 
i see a city in the clouds . 
bespin .   i see it too  .  .  .  friends you have there heh ?   concentrate and see them you will . 
i see them !   .  .  .  they 're in pain  .  .  .  they 're suffering . 
it is the future you see . 
difficult to see .   always in motion is the future  .  .  .  back away little machine ! 
foreknowledge is helpful but painful sometimes and dangerous too .   you have far to go in your training . 
i 've learned so much since then .   and i 'll return to finish  .  .  .  i promise that master . 
if it must be .   yes . 
you 'll find i 'm full of surprises . 
and i too . 
no ! 
there is much obiwan did not tell you .   come the emperor will complete your training . 
i 'll die first . 
that wo n't be necessary . 
time will tell . 
no !   .  .  .  .  never  .  .  .  . 
never . 
how the hell am i supposed to know ?  this is your damn city . 
i do n't know .  somehow i just ca n't leave . 
what the hell is this ? 
the freeway . 
i know that .  there are people in some of these cars . 
it 's where they live .  i guess after everything happened they just needed to do what they 'd always done before .  during the daytime they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep . 
find cuervo jones . 
no !  stay away snake .  he 's mucho muerte . 
who ? 
utopia is lost to me .  my daughter is gone . 
well i 'll think it over . 
you 're running out of time . 
i 've been doin' that all my life .  might as well do it in l . a .  everybody else there is . 
thank god . 
give me the prototype . 
i 'm looking for somebody . 
who ai n't ? 
hershe you were in cleveland ? 
yeah .  with me and texas mike o 'shay . 
what issues from your lust will be mine .  swear it again . 
i swear it . 
doing what i did for you it was n't easy you know .  it takes it 's toll .  it took nine moons to get back my strength . 
i ? 
the child is mine uther .  i have come for him . 
you did n't ask ! 
to kill and be king is that all ? 
maybe not even that uther .  i thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword .  but it 'll take another a greater king .  .  . 
you strike me with words as hard as steel . 
they are not weapons my friend but truths .  you betrayed the duke stole his wife and took his castle now no one trusts you .  lot uryens your allies will turn against you .  give me the child uther i will protect him .  go back to your war tent . 
why it 's perfectly plain your the teacher at the college you do n't want the building torn down . 
c 'mon i can read for christ sake . 
well what 's wrong ? 
well why are they tearing the building down ? 
shall we summon the writer ?  he 's in paris i believe . 
hiding ? 
fuck it . 
and what about the exorcist ?  any ideas ? 
how about lankaster merrin . 
merrin ?  i had notion he was over in iraq .  i think i read he was working on a dig around nineveh . 
that 's right mike .  but he 's finished and came back around three ot four months ago he 's in woodstock now . 
what 's he doing there ?  teaching ? 
no he 's working on another book . 
do n't you think he 's too old though ?  how 's his health ? 
it must be alright .  he 's still running around digging up tombs .  besides he 's had experience . 
i did n't know that . 
ten maybe twelve years ago in africa .  the exorcism supposedly lasted for months .  i heard it damn near killed him . 
i do n't know .  no not really i suppose .  but i 've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the ritual . 
you 'd want to do the exorcism yourself ? 
yes . 
it might be best to have a man with experience .  maybe someone who 's spent time in the foreign missions . 
i see your excellency . 
let 's see whose around .  in the meantime i 'll call you as soon as i know . 
thank you your excellency . 
look i 'm telling you again and you 'd better believe it i 'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum ! 
it 's
and i do n't care what you call it !  i 'm not putting her away ! 
i 'm sorry .

momma i 'm all right i 'm fine really i am . 
i would like you to go quickly over to the resdence damien and gather up a cassock for myself two surplices a purple stole and some holy water and your copy of the roman ritual .  the large one .  i believe we should begin . 
do you want to hear the background of the case first ? 
why ? 
i think it would be helpful if i gave you some background on the different personalities regan has manifested .  so far there seems to be three .  she 's convinced
there 's only one . 
but deliver us from the evil one . 
and it 's especially nice to be among friends tonight because well tonight 's a very special night for my brother and i .  this evening we 've asked a young lady to join us a lady jack and i are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all .   she 's making her debut here this evening and as far as i 'm concerned she could n't be doing it in a better place .  because there 's one place that 's always been for us a very special place and that place is this place the ambassador lounge .   ladies and gentlemen please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song miss susie diamond . 
that 's what i figure .   probably have us in a bedandbreakfast playing to the owls . 
that 's it except for the first .  we got the sheraton the ambassador or the holiday inn on sixtieth .   all threeday turns . 
i 'll take my chances . 
yeah .   something . 
yeah  .  .  .  well i gotta go . 
you wanna get a drink ? 
yeah fine . 
okay i 'll see you tomorrow night then .

you recognized me . 
just a lucky guess . 
so what do you think ? 
very realistic . 
yeah well what can i say ?   dad must 've had forty pounds on me .  jesus you remember him being this big ? 
well the line 's growing weaker little brother .  lucky for us there are n't any dragons left to slay . 
thanks but i 've got plans . 
all right but if you change your mind let me know .   i gotta go get ma in the morning anyway . 
two years ago .   march .

well then  .  .  .  shall we ? 
someone needs to grow up .   i wo n't take it jack . 
you want to tell me what the hell 's going on ? 
huh ? 
i just saw a man walk out of your room . 
uh  .  .  . 
in case you 've forgotten we 're being paid to be here .   so it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency . 
decency ?   hey listen pal  .  .  . 
no .  you listen .   i had my doubts about you from the beginning
i just saw a man walk out of your room ! 
forget it .

and two more times tomorrow night and two more times the next night and the next night and the next night and the next night .   frank i ca n't sing that fucking song anymore ! 
that 'd be me sir .   frank baker .  this is my brother jack . 
yes well they are . 
then i 'm afraid i do n't understand . 
they are in tune .   but not with each other . 
is that important ? 
uh well  .  .  . 
you porked his wife the day he was arrested .   how could you forget that ? 
i do n't know .   everything 's jumbled  so you 're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks . 
a few blanks ?   like what ? 
like  .  .  . 
retching and convulsing while those bastards did n't even try to save her sorry ass .   you gave her mouth to mouth  man  even then you had some constitution . 
after that .   you promised you 'd always take care of me . 
and i bet i 've kept that promise  .  .  . 
only one you 've never broken . 
what 's worse than losing five million bucks ? 
being stuck in this rathole when it blows .   bro what you built was a work of art .  that little fucker belongs in the smithsonian . 
for what ? 
for being one helluva guy . 
thanks ?   i guess they really did fuck you up . 
everything i say is wrong .  i ca n't talk to her anymore . 
she 's only 12 .   some day she 'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying i love you . 
is that what you think ? 
jon  .  .  .  we just remember how it used to be .   you staying for a while or is this just a pissstop ? 
we need to talk . 
i 'm late for surgery .

were you there to catch me ? 
no . 
how come ? 
i do n't know  .  .  .   maybe because you 've never needed my help . 
and you would n't be . 
one last time .   it 's important  .  .  . 
you said you 'd be here !  you promised me  you promised jamie !   what could be more important than that ? 
i ca n't tell you  .  .  .  except only i can do it . 
you want me to tell you it 's okay to leave ?   okay go on !   go ! 
eve listen carefully .   the man you think is your husband  is n't .

what ?   what do you mean you 
sue .  .  . ilook at your handsi . 
let 's not jump to conclusions we need a imassive amount of evidencei before making that leap . 
not in the hands of a great surgeon like dr .  duval .  the beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter . 
i understand you 've been dr .  duval 's assistant for quite some time .  .  .  he must 've snatched you out of the cradle . 
i 've been with him since i got out of school .  he brought me into the cmdf over five years ago . 
a long time with one man . 
not working for someone like dr .  duval 
i always thought it was nothing but red . 
and if it should take more time to get through 
doctor  is it possible ?  that we 're seeing it happen before our eyes ? 
but i did .  i 'm positive ! 
i have no idea . 
not now .  we need air not greetings ! 
you ca n't it 's too dangerous 
not anything built into the chassis .   if it had n't come loose 
no it requires such absolute precision 
a surgeon might .  .  . 
oh yes i 'm sure dr .  duval could .  if we had the parts .

i 'm an incredible woman ?   what is this a death sentence ?

you want to talk ?   come on jack .  .  .  did i cross the line by mentioning the future or what ? 
no .  .  .  it 's just .  .  . 
slowed things down ?   where have i been ?   have we been going fast !  ? 
right now i 'm just not sure about .  .  .  making such definite plans . 
first of all let me tell you something  you do n't know shit .  second of all as far as uweu go what time do you need ?   what have we been doing here except utimeu ?   have i ever .  .  .  ever pressured you !  ? 
no . 
no .   so what time do you need ?   i love you  you love me  you want to get your career going great !   i 'd like to be a part of it  i think i deserve that !   so what do you need to figure out alone !  ? 
i did n't know .   i just said all i want is some time . 
bullshit !   if you 're going to hurt me you hurt me now  not some long .  .  .  drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you do n't have the balls ! 
all right .  .  .  i 'll pack my stuff tonight . 
ulistenu !   we both got something out of it all right ! 
oh yeah ?   what did i get ?   what did i get i could n't 've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week ?   you think your company is such a treat ?   your moods your .  .  .   pain your problems .  .  .  you think you 're entertaining ? 
then what do you want to stay with me for ? 
how have you been ? 
terrific .  going on alot of dates  .  .  .  seeing lots of men .  .  .  lots of dates .  . 
huhhuh .  .  .  . you son of a bitch ! 
he ca n't hear you .   hi .  .  . i 'm dr .  weintraub .  .  .  .   i was on duty when they brought him in .  .  . i 've been going over his record .  .  .  he was brought in once before i understand .  .  .    .  .  . catatonic  stupor .  .  . condition  rendered him nonverbal for a period of  .  .  . 
yeah so ?  the guy 's beat up  he .  .  . he probably has a concussion or something right ?   he 'll snap out of it ? 
i 'm afraid not  .  .  .  then again i 'm not sure .  the beating 's bad but it 's not the problem .  .  .  it seems he 's .  .  reexperiencing the catatonia .  .  .  so like before he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years .  .  .   .  .  .  . i do n't know .  there 's no way to tell . 
but .  . how could that happen ? 
well it 's not unusual in his case .  .  .  sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system .  the brain never loses anything  it just stores it up and waits .  a person could actually reexperience the full effect of a tragedy long after the event took place .  are you relatives ?   well it does n't matter .  we 'll take care of it .  he 'll have to be sent back to the same institution .  .  
what if i was a relative ? 
you 'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it would n't be the best thing for him .  he needs hospital care .  i just thought you could sign the release forms but the city can do that .  i would n't feel responsible in any way .  there 's really nothing you can do .  i 'm sorry . 
i hope that 's all you gotta say el cause i 'm about as tired of your mouth as i am workin' this stinkin' hole ! 
i got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the indian nation didn' i tell you .  .  . 
well lemme play the other side then .

you 're playing the other side . 
serveza yourself !

no i 'm not mad at you hand .  it 'll be all right .  just spot and follow through .  .  . 
that 's right . 
i do n't believe vou . 
that 's what you said ? 
something witty and devastating like that . 
i 'm fine . 
carl restored my confidence .  he really did .  he 's much more substantial than you give him credit for .

yes . 
yeah i think i could . 
what ? 
i could spend some time with you tomorrow morning before carl comes back i mean if you 'd like to . 
of course i 'd like to .

just give me a chance will you ? 
i 'm trying to be delicate with you but you 're not understanding me .  it 's not just because of carl or my music but because of you .  .  .   i mean what would it come to ?  if a person has no love for himself no respect no love for his work his family his friends something .  .  .  how can he ask for love in return ?  i mean why should he ask for it ? 
what 'll it be fletch ?

what long distance ? i could n't help but hear you say something about rio alan .  you 're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars i staked you for the next load are you ?

it probably would n't have any effect on him .   the only sure way to stop jason is to return him to his original resting place where he drowned in 1957 . 
lake forest green ?

knowing who a person is .  down deep . 
even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking ? 
you wo n't even tell me your name .  what 's shocking about a name ? 
it does .  we must be getting old charlie .

i think if we all worked to publicize it .  .  .  all of the congress .  .  .  every avenue we know . 
the government 's afraid and they do n't know what to do .  but they 're more afraid of terrorists than of you .  the viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non violence . 
i 've never spoken for anything else . 
at least you 're honest .   call me by my middle nameeugeneif you 're going to be jerome you may as well start getting used to it .

that 's how it was in the old world pop but this is not sicily . 
i know .   i know michael .   it 's christmas your brothers and sister are all here  we are happy .  let 's not spoil this .   go your own way but when you are ready come to me the way a son should .   i have hopes for you .  .  . 
i 'm not afraid of his words .

he will grow strong . 
the child cannot harm you . 
he will be a man and then he will come for revenge . 
 my two friends have my share of the money .   i 'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler . 
you tell your friends i expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner .   do n't be afraid to tell them .   clemenza and i know each other well he understands these things .   let yourself be guided by him .   he has more experience in these matters . 
 you must understand this is all new to me .  .  . 
i understand .  .  . 
but thank you for speaking to me as a godfather . 
 you 're a good fellow . 
i 'm a little short .   i 've been out of work .   let me owe you the money for a few weeks . 
ah you 're a sharp young fellow .  how is it i 've never noticed you before  you 're too quiet for your own interest .   i could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable .   no hard feelings eh ?   if i can ever do you a service let me know .  you 've done a good job for yourself tonight . 
let him gamble . 
okay .   you know he does n't have that kind of money . 
yes . 
no . 
this witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a new york police captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named virgil sollozzo .   do you deny this ? 
i deny his every charge . 
is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the five families in new york to assume and consolidate your nefarious power ? 
that is a complete falsehood . 
is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in las vegas ? 
that is not true .   i own some stock in some of the hotels but only very small amounts .   i also own some american telephone and ibm stock . 
i do not . 
do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of new york . 
i do not . 
when do we talk ? 
after dinner . 
we were all heartbroken at the news but that was n't cause to start a war . 
okay now it 's my family in brooklyn and i wanna keep up clemenza 's loyalty to you .   but how can i run my family with you challenging my every move ?   you 're too far from the street mike the only way to reason with the rosato brothers is to whack em and whack em fast . 
you were unfair with them . 
says who ? 
clemenza promised rosato three territories in the bronx after he died and then you took over and welched . 
clemenza promised them nothing he hated the sonsuvbitches . 
they feel cheated . 
michael you 're sitting up here in the sierra mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way i run my family . 
your family still carries the name corleone and you will run it like a corleone ! 
and while i feed my family in new york you put the knife in my back in miami . 
frankie you 're a good old man and you 've been loyal to my father for years .  .  . so i hope you can explain what you mean . 
the rosatos are running crazy taking hostages spitting in my face because they 're backed by the jew in miami . 
i know .   that 's why i want you to be fair with them . 
how can you be fair with animals ?  they recruit niggers and spicks they do violence in their own grandmother 's neighborhoods .   and everything is dope and whores the gambling is left to last .   let me run my family without you on my back .   i want them taken care of . 
no .   there are things that i have planned with hyman roth .   i do n't want them disturbed . 
you give your loyalty to a jew over your own blood . 
frankie you know my father respected roth did business with him . 
he did business .  .  . but he never trusted him . 
i did n't want you to know i was coming .   you heard what happened in my home ? 
michael yes we was all relieved .  .  . 
in my home !   in the same room where my wife was sleeping where my children come in their pajamas and play with their toys . 
michael anything .   what is it i can do for you ? 
i want you to settle these troubles with the rosato brothers . 
i was just going to contact you michael we just had a sitdown'  in fact i just come from there . 
i want you to settle on their terms . 
mike i do n't understand .   do n't ask me to do that . 
trust me do as i ask . 
it would be the beginning of the end for my family .   how can i keep all my other territories in like if i let two wiseguys stand up and demand this and that and then give it to them ? 
frankie .  .  . do you respect me ?   do i have your loyalty ? 
always .  .  .  but sometimes i do n't understand .   i know i 'll never have your kind of brains in big deals .  but mike this is a street thing .  and hyman roth in miami is behind the rosato brothers . 
i know . 
then why do you want me to lay down to them ? 
frankie roth tried to have me killed .   i 'm sure it was him but i do n't know yet why . 
jesus christ michael then let 's hit em now while we still got the muscle . 
this was my father 's old study .  when i was a kid we had to be quiet when we played near here .  when i was older i learned many things from him here .   i was happy that this house never went to strangers first clemenza took it over and then you .   my father taught me in this room never to act until you know everything that 's behind things .   never .   if hyman roth sees that i interceded with you in the rosato brothers' favor he 'll think his relationship with me is still sound .   i 'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow .   we have friends in some very important business that we 're making .   do this for me you make the peace with the rosato brothers on their terms .   let the word out that i forced you you 're not happy wit hit but acquiesced just because of me .   it will get back to hyman roth .   do this frankie .   you can trust me . 
sure mike .   i 'll go along . 
good . 
i thought we would meet alone . 
i trust these men with my life .  they are my right arms i cannot insult them by sending them away . 
some water . 
turnbull is a good man . 
let 's forget the bullshit i do n't want to stay here any longer than i have to .   you can have the license for two hundred and fifty thousand in cash plus a monthly fee equal to five percent of the gross .  .  . 
do i look okay ? 
if that 's okay ? 
nothing would please me more . 
i do n't hear anything . 
exactly .   cukor was too cheap to hire music .   there 's nothing but chinwag .   the cold dreary custard of english chinwag . 
nothing of importance .   just two old men slapping each other with lilies .   shall we have a drink ? 
david .   the friend i thought was in new york . 
no .   the girl . 
girl ?   oh .   elizabeth taylor .

okay .   frankenstein .   tell me everything . 
righto .   let me see . 
who came up with the monster 's makeup and look ? 
my idea .   muchly .   my sketches .  big heavy brow .   head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new like tinned beef .

you think so ?   that 's very kind 
i just need to  lie down .  studio .   daybed in studio . 
head .   not heart .

some shows are worth the price of admission partner . 
who ? 
einstein .  had two marriages both trainwrecks .  the guy never saw his kids one of whom i think ended up in an asylum
i do . 
well you 're the only one . 
look i do n't know what else i can say .  i 'm not sitting at home every night twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy 's life .  but it 's important to start early .  i was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twentythree years to do something worthy of a field 's medal . 
maybe he does n't care about that . 
now wait a minute gerry
no no you hear me out sean .  this young man is a true prodigy
personal rivalry ?  i 'm not getting back at you . 
look you took one road and i took another .  that 's fine . 
is it gerry ?  cause i do n't think it 's fine with you .  give him time to figure out what he wants . 
that 's a wonderful theory sean .  it worked wonders for you . 
now wait a minute
and confuse him
gerry
and here i am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake
hold on ! 
ready to falsify documents because you 've given him license to walk away from this . 
i know what i 'm doing and i know why i 'm here ! 
look sean i do n't care if you have a rapport with the boy i do n't care if you have a few laughs even at my expense !  but do n't you dare undermine what i 'm trying to do here . 
undermine ? 
he has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility .  and you do n't understand that he 's at a fragile point
he is at a fragile point .  he 's got problems
what problems does he have sean that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with
why do you think he does that gerry ? 
he can handle the work he can handle the pressure and he 's obviously handled you . 
why is he hiding ?  why is he a janitor ?  why does n't he trust anybody ?  because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most ! 
oh come on sean
and why does he hang out with his friends ?  because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to .  it 's called loyalty ! 
oh that 's nice
and who do you think he 's handling ?  he pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him .  and for 20 years he 's been alone because of that .  and if you try to push him into this it 's going to be the same thing all over again .  and i 'm not going to let that happen to him ! 
now do n't do that .  do n't you do that !  do n't infect him with the idea that it 's okay to quit .  that it 's okay to be a failure because it 's not okay !  if you 're angry at me for being successful for being what you could have been
i 'm not angry at you
yes you are sean .  you resent me .  and i 'm not going to apologize for any success that i 've had . 
i do n't have any anger at you
yes you do .  you 're angry at me for doing what you could have done .  ask yourself if you want will to feel that way for the rest of his life to feel like a failure . 
that 's it .  that 's why i do n't come to the goddamn reunions !  becaue i ca n't stand the look in your eye when you see me !  you think i 'm a failure !  i know who i am .  i 'm proud of who i am .  and all of you you think i 'm some kind of pity case !  you with your sycophant students following you around .  and you goddamn medal ! 
is that what this is about sean ?  the field 's medal ?  do you want me to go home and get it for you ?  then will you let the boy
i do n't want your trophy and i do n't give a shit about it !  cause i knew you when !  !  you and jack and tom sanders .  i knew you when you were homesick and pimplyfaced and did n't know what side of the bed to piss on ! 
that 's right !  you were smarter than us then and you 're smarter than us now !  so do n't blame me for how your life turned out .  it 's not my fault . 
i do n't blame you !  it 's not about that !  it 's about the boy !  cause he 's a good kid !  and i wo n't see this happen to him i wo n't see you make him feel like a failure too ! 
he wo n't be a failure ! 
if you push him into something if you ride him
you 're wrong sean .  i 'm where i am today because i was pushed .  and because i learned to push myself ! 
he 's not you ! 
come in . 
sean .  .  .

i do n't know .  .  .  gotta be at least four to one . 
about thirty million to one . 
you 're pretty quick with those numbers .  how about the odds of me buying the first round ? 
about thirty million to one . 
i do n't know what these cops got to do with it but i do n't like it .   an' these here are our own people all of em .  i do n't like this . 
thing 's been workin' on me what they was yellin' about .  got me all curious . 
fanbelt 's shot . 
gallon or two ? 
well looks like we done it this time awright ! 
she got to make it . 
i guess that 's what he looked like . 
we just picked him up on the way in .  he went away this mornin' when the rate dropped . 
what 'd he look like again ? 
short fella .  pale face . 
was he bruised up this mornin' ?  about the face ? 
i did n't see nothin' . 
okay .  go on . 
banana cream pineapple cream chocolate creamand apple . 
cut me off a hunk a that banana cream and a cuppa java . 
what 's it to you ? 
them was nickel apiece candy . 
hey wait a minute .  you got change comin' .

that 's not your affair .  name . 
joad . 
how many men ?

women ? 
two . 
kids ? 
two . 
can all of you work ? 
why i guess so . 
okay .  house 63 .  wages 5 cents a box .  no bruised fruit .  move along and go to work right away . 
but it do n't seem possiblekicked off like that ! 
the rest of my fambly set out for the westthere was n't nothin' to eatbut i could n't leave .  somepin' would n't let me .  so now i just wander around .  sleep wherever i am .  i used to tell myself i was lookin' out for things so when they come back ever'thing would be all right .  but i knowed that wa n't true .  there ai n't nothin' to look out for .  and ai n't nobody comin' back .  they 're gone and me i 'm just an ol graveyard ghostthat 's all in the world i am . 
hide out for what ?  we ai n't doin' nothin' . 
you 're trespassin' !  it ai n't you lan' no more !  an' that 's the supr'tendantwith a gun ! 
wo n't they come out here ? 
i do n't think so .  one come out here once an' i clipped him from behin' with a fence stake .  they ai n't bothered since . 
but we could n't do on any less 'n what our share is now .   the chillun ai n't gettin' enough to eat as it is and they 're so ragged we 'd be shamed if ever 'body else 's chillun was n't the same way . 
i ca n't help that .  all i know is i got my orders .  they told me to tell you you got to get off and that 's what i 'm telling you . 
now do n't go blaming me .  it ai n't my fault . 
it ai n't nobody .  it 's a company . 
brother i do n't know .  if i did i 'd tell you .  but i just do n't know who 's to blame ! 
well i 'm right here to tell you mister ai n't nobody going to push me off my land !  grampa took up this land seventy years ago .  my pa was born here .  we was all born on it and some of us got killed on it and some died on it .  and that 's what makes it ournbein' born on it and workin' it and dyin' on itand not no piece of paper with writin' on it !  so just come on and try to push me off ! 
why she was n't no more 'n a kid when i went up . 
sol' things chopped cottoneven grampa .  got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol' .  shucked out seventy five for this truck but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on .  i figger we oughta be able to make it on that . 
easy .  after all they ai n't but about twelve of us is they ? 
ca n't tie him .  either we 'll hurt him or he 'll git so mad he 'll hurt his self .   reckon we could git him drunk ? 
ai n't no whisky is they ? 
those all seem kind of related .  .  . 
here .  take my card .  wait a minute .  .  .  here 's a special one .  for topshelf clients . 
nope . 
i guess . 
seventeen months ago i was posting a walk in lisbon and he was there .  he never saw me .  but i saw him though . 
lisbon ? 
in portugal yes .

i do n't think so . 
well remember when frysal 's men paid off the deejay in cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the 
nooo
yes .  and the munich olympics in '72 .  a local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened . 
it was the plo . 
whatever . 
we ca n't do our job unless he does his job . 
why do n't we just do his job then so we can do our job and get the fuck out of here . 
do his job ?  i 'm not a coldblooded killer . 
wait a minute
look .  you want to kill a good guy but not be a bad guy you wait until a bad guy kills the good guy and then you come in and kill the bad guy and then you 're the good guy . 
so if we do his job we 're the bad guys .  if we do our job we 're the good guys . 
yup . 
he using her . 
you 're wrong .  look at his face . 
one cannot love and kill . 
i love .  i kill .

well now you know what it feels like . 
for you !  because i 'm your daughter which means you 're the best mother !  is n't that what you 're always talking about in interviews  having it all the great career the great family .  .  .  proving everybody wrong .  wanting everybody to think you 're this perfect woman !

i 'm working on that .   it 's just i got some business problems and .  .  .  whatsa matter ?

yeah .   i 'll see ya .  .  .  dad . 
joey ! 
uh no . 
mmmmm .   well it 's complicated .  maybe when you 're older .   anyhow what i 'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence okay ?   it do n't go no further .   what happened is you remember that night i was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch  .  .  ? 
you were saying you do n't want a million dollars . 
well i 'm not entitled to a million dollars .   i .  .  .  i .  .  .  did n't expect .  .  .  i did n't expect .  .  . 
all the adulation ?   it makes you feel like a fake does n't it ? 
uh actually .  .  .  yes .  .  .  i .  .  .  should never have come forward and presented myself as 
yes . 
 .  .  . unworthy of the adoration .   we all do . 
you 're a celebrity john .   people are going to want to please you .  .  .  or use you .  .  .  or both . 
john i 'm sure she could support just about anything .   i think i 'll see you to your room .  a sort of bodyguard .   make sure no harm comes to you . 
no thanks mom  i 'll go up to bed now . 
do you want me to come up and tuck you in ? 
that 's okay mom . 
neil do n't leave the back doors open  i do n't want holly near the pool . 
we 'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool . 
what ? 
you 're thinking exactly what i thought when i first saw this house
what 's that ? 
this  is  the  one  for  us . 
stop knowing me so well . 
i know it 's at the high end of our range 
high end ?   honey it 's a whole new budget . 
but it 's what we want . 
you wanted furniture too did n't you ? 
they do n't expect to get what they 're asking .   let 's make an offer . 
you want me to bargain at the high end of our range ?    i 'll have a stroke .   i 've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks . 
you could have a pool to cool off in . 
it 's a nice pool is n't it ? 
and it 's a shorter commute . 
it 'll be even shorter if i get that new job .   come on . 
honey nobody buys a house overnight  if someone else comes back at them well we might have to make a counter offer .   but we ca n't look too eager or we 'll get screwed . 
it 's very nice but it 's still a little pricey for us . 
paul newman in the hustler . 
good  that 's what i was trying to project . 
damn .

he made you know a remark .

 and keep my kids away from his property  who the hell does he think he is ?   some nice neighborhood . 
honey the meeting today is going to be fine .   do n't get in an uproar . 
i know .   it 's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me . 
it 's just a dumb game they play .  you want to be at a bigger firm get used to the politics . 
huh ? 
how was your lunch with charlie ? 
oh  great .

 the saturation chamber .  where he wanted to put me .

donald w .  blackburn m . d . 
i got an engraved  literally  invitation  with my name

ms .  marr ! 
is she alright ? 
three times to be exact . 
excuse me ? 
accidents .  fatal .  each of your prior wives so we 've been informed .

and then what happens ? 
i think it 's something better experienced then described . 
i would n't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded beanie babies had n't tested 100 safe . 
i 've designed and built six of these places  take my word for it everything 's fine . 
like what ?  ?  this is n't supposed to be happening !  ! 
maybe if i 
i ca n't remember at the moment . 
alright mr .  pritchett let me just sign the damn thing . 
you did n't think much about that before . 
look i thought we were all right on this maura .   it 's over .   you know that . 
whatever you say . 
to our family . 
did anyone in your family keep in touch with her ? 
not really .   she was just one of those names you hear growing up .  you know soandso who lives in ireland .   i really do n't think anyone knew about this place . 
or what she was worth . 
i do n't think she willed it to me out of sentiment .   she did n't even know who i was .   it 's just .  .  .  tradition . 
what ? 
it 's not going to work .   i 'm too smart for you . 
i do n't know .   that 's strange . 
she 's asleep .   i think that 's what i need too .  i 'm starting to see things . 
yeah well i 'll be joining you shortly .   i just want to .  .  . 
ok . 
were you fooling with the power ? 
no . 
did n't you just see the power go off and on ?   i just had a bulb break on me ! 
it 's okay .   it 's just someone burned me once . 
yes i do .   terri something awful happened to that boy .   i have to find out what it was . 
but i do n't know anything !   really .   i just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street .   he  .  .  . 
did you know him ? 
no .   i 'd seen him in there a few times before .   he was just a punk .   i 'd never like danced with him or anything .  anyway he was a thief .   he must 've taken it from the statue . 
taken what ? 
the thing !   he was lying there in the street moaning .   but he pointed at it  .  .  .  22
wait a minute .   he was already  .  .  .  wounded  .  .  .  when you found him ? 
yeah !   that 's what i 'm saying !   and it was lying next to him .   and he pointed at it before he passed out and  .  .  . 
wait .   wait .   the chains .   where did the chains come from ? 
that 's what i 'm trying to tell you !   .  .  . 
right  .  .  .  that 's  .  .  .  er  .  .  .  that 's nice of you terri .   can i ask ?   is it always this  .  .  .  exploratory ? 
ha !   i do n't know yet .   first time .  kitchen virgin that 's me . 
i 'll do it ! 
no !   no that 's ok .   i like to .   i love boiling water .   it 's a specialty of mine .   why do n't you go watch cartoons ? 
the bank owns it .   but i 'm working on it . 
jeez i 've never owned anything .   i have n't even had a room of my own since i was fifteen years old . 
guys .   sometimes friends .   mostly guys . 
no .   i buy them to impress people .   of course i 've read them . 
cool .   i read a book once .   it was like all these people discovering who they used to be .   you know like reincarnation ?   it was really good .   you ever read that ? 
i do n't think so .   but it 's a fascinating subject .   did you  .  .  . 
who 's that ? 
and he still sits there ? 
every day . 
maybe he thinks it 'll come back . 
no .   he knows it wo n't .   it was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him does n't yet . 
maybe not .   but you know more than i do .  you know something about this box .  something about a statue ? 
yeah .   i found it .   i knew held like it and i figured  .  .  . 
woah .   wait a minute .   who ?   the kid ? 
no .   jp .   my last boyfriend ?   he like owns the club .   you know ?   you were there ?   he bought the statue . 
that you found .   what do you mean you found it ? 
forget about itit was nothing anybody would have done the same thingit 's an impulse .  .  . 
no i meant you did n't have to tackle me and rip my dress .   a polite push perhaps ?   a clear shout of watch out anna would have done nicely .  .  . 
excuse me milady .   i would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud but i left my cape at the cleaners . 
because danger doc is my middle .  .  . 
yes and my giraffe loves it too .  .  . 
that 's what you theenk . 
question sir ?    his untiring pen predicted the airplane the submarine the bicycle the helicopter and even the tank . 
never why do you ask ? 
sure hudson .   are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on dumbo ? 
could you believe that crazy elephant ? 
delivers up to ten at night .   the pope has an obsession with his easter seals .   it 's actually not that an unusual setup .   the secret passageway on the other hand .  .  .  . 
the vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed not explained . 
nice .   but right out of our brochure . 
oh you read that . 
actually i wrote it .   it 's a good sentence .   it can apply to people . 
you 're not an unmysterious thang yourself . 
i do n't steal stuffed elephants from little girls .   and i buy my own clothes .   my life 's a little boring .  .  . 
god i wish i could say the same thing .   what about having a nice dull dinner with me tonight .  scrabble knockknock jokes anecdotes about famous dead italians .  .  .  . 
i 'll bring my entire repertoire .  .  . 
secret passageways do n't mean as much as they used to .   there 's a place two blocks east of here .  enzo 's .   say 1030 . 
said . 
i never break a date .   scout 's honor . 
prison ? 
i was the warden ? 
how long were you in ? 
let 's just say i never saw e . t . 
wow you were in the joint .  doing hard time .   it 's funny but that excites me .   i seem to have a thing for sinners . 
i seem to have a thing for sinning .  sinning .   check please .  .  .  . 
why yes do you know it ? 
oh no really i 
do n't bother to thank me it 's the easiest thing in the world .  matter of fact i know where a vacancy just came up . 
of course  i went to the muncie uh secretarial polytechnic ! 
well i just do n't know how to thank you mr .  barnes 
please !  norville ! 
well i .  .  .  did n't bother to read the article .  i did n't think the picture did you justice . 
the picture was fine !  it 's what that knuckleheaded dame wrote underneath !  of all the irresponsible .  .  .  amy take this down dear miss archer .  i call you miss' because you seem to have missed' the boat completely on this one !  how on earth would you know whether i 'm an imbecile when you do n't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man !  no change guts' to courage . no make it common decency . these wild speculations about my intelligence 
 or lack thereof ? 
 these preposterous inventions would be better suited to the pages of amazing tales magazine .  if the editors of the manhattan argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter !  but i doubt it .  i most seriously doubt it .  as i doubt also that you could find a home at amazing tales a periodical which i have enjoyed for many years .  yours sincerely et cetera . 
 .  .  . well you know me amy at least better than that that dame does .  do you think i 'm an imbecile ? 
i 'm sure i 
go on tell the truth i trust you and i put a lot of stock in your opinion . 
well i 
oh sure you 're biased  you 're a fellow muncian .  but would an imbecile come up with this ? 
 .  .  . why do n't i just type this up .  .  . 
aww naw amy that wo n't be necessary .  i should n't send it she 's just doing her job i guess . 
well i do n't know maybe she does deserve it .  maybe she should 've come in to face you man to man . 
well she probably had a deadline .  .  . 
sure but  she could still have gotten your side for the record ! 
well it 's done now  what 's the use of grousing about it .  forget the letter amy i just had to blow off some steam .  .  . 
yeah you know probably one of these fasttalking career gals thinks she 's one of the boys .  probably is one of the boys if you know what i mean . 
i 'm quite sure i do n't know what you mean . 
yeah you know .  suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays .  seems pretty obvious does n't it ?  she 's probably very unattractive and bitter about it . 
oh is that it ! 
yeah you know .  probably dresses in men's clothing swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named biff or smoocher or .  .  . 
smitty . 
exactly .  and i bet she 's ugly .  real ugly .  otherwise why would n't they print her picture next to her byline ? 
maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance . 
i bet that 's exactly what she tells herself !  but you and i both know she 's just a driedup bitter old maid .  say how about you and i grab a little dinner and a show after work ?  i was thinking maybe the king and i 
oh .  nothing really just .  .  .  the more timid investors are no longer running for cover . 
let me look . 
let me hold it or you 'll have a real shiner . 
thanks .  people seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story . 
 .  .  . i 'm sorry . 
oh it is n't your fault amy .  you 're the one person who 's been standing by me through all this . 
oh mrs .  rand 
come come do n't tell me how sorry you are that i should meet you this way .   i 'm even a little glad that wesley 's difficulty brought us together . 
nonsense child !   i know wesley 's been drinking too much lately .   i know a great deal more about what goes on at fort holland than you 'd think .   i know all about you  that you 're a nice girl competent and kind to jessica .   the fort needs a girl like you .   but now we 've got to get you back there .   i 'll walk you back and stay over night .   it 'll be a nice change for me . 
so  he says i 'm nice .   he 's a nice boy too miss connell a very nice boy .   but i 'm worried about his drinking . 
use your influence with paul .   ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table . 
i 've no influence with mr .  holland . 
try it  you may have more influence than you think . 
you 've never said anything about voodoo before mrs .  rand . 
have n't i ?   i suppose i take it for granted .  it 's just part of everyday life here . 
you do n't believe in it ? 
a missionary 's widow ?   it is n't very likely is it ? 
i do n't mean believe like believing in a religion .   i mean do you believe it has power ?   do you think it could heal a sick person ? 
frankly my dear i did n't expect anything like this from a nice levelheaded girl .   what are you driving at ? 
i heard the servants talking about someone called mama rose .  they said she had been mindless .  .  . 
her son drowned .   she brooded until her mind was affected .  all the houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology . 
wait .  do n't draw any conclusions .  let me explain . 
but mrs .  rand 
i knew you 'd come .  and i knew i 'd have to come up here and talk to you .  i could n't let you go back without any word .  i came to tell you again  jessica cannot be cured . 
but how did you get here ?  what are you doing here ? 
i asked you to let me explain .  it 's a long story .   and not an easy one 
but you did n't have to come up here . 
perhaps not .   but i did come here and i found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me .  once started it seemed such an easy way to do good .   i should have known there was no easy way to do good betsy . 
that 's sweet of you mrs .  rand . 
you must betsy .  they 'll have to believe you . 
mrs .  rand was at the houmfort that night .   but there 's nothing wrong with that .   she 's gone there for years  trying to take care of those people  to help them . 
i do n't know .   i prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened  feeling nothing knowing nothing . 
well the whole gamut .  facts of life and all .  some fatherly advice because i tell you there 's things happening that you 're probably old enough .  .  .  well .  .  .   for example on the selfabuse front  now this is important  it 's not advisable to do it in the shower  it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case  and um not onto the linen and not on your sister 's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother 
uh dad you know i 'm 16 . 
all the more reason for this little heart to heart .  .  .  great . 
sure dad . 
thanks . 
stay out of trouble . 
libbets .  libbets casey . 
libbets ?  what kind of name is libbets ? 
ben

you 're boring me .  i have a husband .  i do n't particularly feel the need for another . 
you have a point there .  that 's a very good point .  we 're having an affair .  right .  an explicitly sexual relationship .  your needs .  my needs .  you 're absolutely right . 
you should probably get dressed .  the boys will be home soon . 
gotcha . 
after the thanksgiving i had i need it .  you having one ? 
in a bit . 
have i noticed anything ?  i 'm not married to her benjamin you are .  i think you 've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her . 
yeah but i  i 've been working a lot lately and  no that 's not it .  i guess we 've just been on the verge of saying something whatever it is just saying something to each other .  on the verge . 
birth control . 
right .  gotcha . 
damn right but where the hell were you ? 
what are you talking about ? 
do n't bullshit me around janey .  jesus christ i waited around for more than half an hour in nothing but my boxer shorts and  and what 's all that about ?  what the hell happened ? 
what are you doing ? 
just thought i 'd stop by . 
mike 's out  i think he went to silver meadow to see if you were hanging around there . 
yeah . 
are you his girlfriend ? 
no . 
if it was n't raining we could take him outside and blow him up . 
he would n't blow up .  he 'd just get all mangled or twisted . 
communist viet cong . 
they left it in the jungle . 
do n't worry about them .  they 're at that party getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about mcgovern and stuff . 
vodka ? 
you never tasted the stuff ? 
one more shot ? 
okay . 
huh ? 
that 's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff like after a sexy dream . 
that 's nice .  are you drunk ? 
i do n't know .  how do i know ? 
i do n't know either .  you spin around when you lie down . 
that 's all for now . 
detective dormer 's not leaving for a few hours . 
good . 
maybe you could drive him to spencer 's . 
sure . 
yes and very beautiful . 
your lips they did n't move . 
they did but too fast for you to see them .  no magic just grace and speed . 
we had feared we were the only ones .  .  . 
but how did you come into existence ? 
are you the leader of tis group ? 
if there were a leader i would be the one . 
ah !  you have questions ? 
what are we ? 
nothing if not vampires .  .  . 
who made us what we are ? 
surely you know the one who made you .  .  . 
but the one who made him who made the one who made him the source of all this evil .  .  . 
you mean we are not children of satan ? 
no . 
then there is nothing . 
perhaps .  .  . 
then god does not exist .  .  . 
i have not spoken to him .  .  . 
and no vampire here has discourse with god or the devil ? 
none that i 've ever known .  i know nothing of god or the devil i have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul .  and as far as i know after four hundred years i am the oldest living vampire in the world . 
you fell too much .  so much you make me feel .  .  . 
he knew nothing .  he just did n't care . 
knew ?  you mean he is .  .  . 
listen to me . 
but how do you know ? 
read her thoughts . 
i ca n't . 
the dark gift is different for each of us .  but one thing is true of everyone .  we grow stronger as we go along . 
i do n't know any hell 
paris ?  you came from paris ? 
as did the one who made me . 
tell me about him .  you must have lernt something from him !  it had to happen for you as it did for me ! 
i learnt absolutely nothing .  i was n't give a choice remember ? 
but you must know something about the meaning of it all you must know where we come from why we .  .  . 
come the new orleans then .  there 's an opera on tonight .  a real french opera !  we can dine in splendour ! 
i respect life do n't you see ?  for each and every human life i have respect . 
respect me a little then .  i 'm the only life you know . 
what you would n't do .  it 's almost sunrise .  it will be the sun or the fire .  you said they can kill me .  the sun or the fire ! 
where do you think my idiot friend ?  we 're in a nice filthy cemetery .  does this make you happy ?  is this fitting and proper enough ? 
and what if there is no hell or they do n't want us there ?  ever think of that ? 
i 'm not interested in you .  you disgust me .  i 'm interested in my own nature and know i ca n't trust you to tell me the truth about me . 
what do you imagine you are louis ? 
i do n't pretend to know . 
do n't you understand louis that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity .  .  .  you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of god . 
vampires are killers .  predators who 's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment . 
i know .  let her alone . 
i 've got to see . 
then we fight 
karla i just wanted the whole thing to be over .  i did n't want to involve anybody else . 
it 's too late for that .

come on you can make it . 
i 'm right here .  grab my hand . 
no you 're not .

ray we 're just friend . 
every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the goodfriend thing first . 
why are you being like this ? 
ca n't what ? 
i just feel like some part of me has n't healed up enough to go back .  like some critical piece is missing .  please understand .  .  . 
i have lived long enough to doubt everything  which is to say i believe everything a little . 
let us put it to the test .  protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of .  i 'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to hermes  not that i believe in him any more than i do in science . 
very well .  i 'll wager a dinner . 
i just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you . 
my friend  what can one say 
you can have your servants prepare a dinner .  that is the way i 'll meet my old familiar enemy  death i have fought him before .  i 've won often .  now he wins .  let him come for me at my own banquet . 
i must meet him with laughter  with songs and laughter  to show him i am not afraid 
this was once a cemetery . 
they were gore before i came here . 
but why ? 
all the graves ? 
i 'm afraid so .  there were rumors people were aroused .  some feared restlessness among the dead you know the old superstitions . 
i donut understand . 
i 'll get ida to make up your bed . 
your lip 's stopped bleeding too george . 
our clothes are dry . 
you have n't got your wings .  yeah that 's right .

oh yeah .  hey little fellow  you worry me .  you got someplace to sleep ? 
no . 
you do n't huh ?  well you got any money ? 
no wonder you jumped in the river . 
i jumped in the river to save you so i could get my wings .

every time you hear a bell ring it means that some angel 's just got his wings . 
why ?  do n't they believe in angels ? 
what do you mean i was n't there ?  i remember distinctly  .   .   .

something wrong ? 
you know overman ? 
do n't hurry back . 
it 's not that easy .   worked construction every summer to get through school .   three years apprentice in the park 's engineering department and two years to build all this .   finish school first sean .   then make up your mind .   if you still want to work with me we 'll have plenty of time . 
you and kathryn gonna stay here ? 
this company 's expanding .   they got parks in texas ohio california .   i think i 'm gonna be going to waco . 
well dad asked me to ask you this about the wedding .   is there any chance you and kathryn will get married in amity ? 
tell dad we 're getting married in las vegas .   in one of those chapels .   he can meet us there . 
yeah he 'll really go for that . 
it 's all up to kathryn .   amity 's fine with me if it 's fine with her . 
we 're in love .

no really .   i 've never met anyone like her before .   this is it . 
yeah right .   that 's what you said about janet and beth and barbara 
puppy love .   this time it 's real !  we can have a double wedding . 
that bugger moves fast . 
give me a 400foot magazine  we may be down there for a while . 
i would n't mind going down with her . 
she is a lovely bit of crumpet at that . 
absolutely .   the audience will stain their drawers .   i did . 
that 's what grandmas are for . 
sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the jeep . 
do n't bother hoagie .  .  .  . 
no . 
why 'd you come out here ? 
why 'd you take the boat ? 
there 's a lot .  .  . i want to talk about it .  .  .  . 
promise me .  .  .  . 
i 'll wear my rubbers .  .  . i 'll be careful  .  .  . i 'll be .  .  .  . 
i 'm going to finish what jake and i started .   i owe him that .   hell i owe him everything .  .  .  .   i 'll get something important done for both of us .  .  .  . 
first time for everything is the best .   after that you know too much and it 's never quite the same . 
you must get bored easily . 
i 'm the captain of this majestic ship .   it goes where i take it .  .  .  . 
mostly it feels like driving .   you digging for buried treasure ? 
sometimes talking to a stranger is easier .  .  .  . 
i .  .  . i ca n't explain it .   it 's just something i feel . 
i always listen to my feelings .  .  .  . 
it could have been an accident .  .  .  . 
it was no accident .  .  .  . 
i 'm not saying you 're wrong just that there are other possibilities .  .  .  . 
when it killed sean it was like a stab in the heart .   i knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him .  i knew that .   i know it 's coming .  .  .  . 
anybody ever tell you you 're nuts .  .  .  . 
it 'll work .  .  .  . 
theory partner .  .  . if it responds to external electrical impulse it might respond to one coming from inside it .  .  . confuse it .  .  . drive it away .  .  .  . 
if we 're real lucky it 'll eat itself .  .  .  . 
the big picture .  .  . if we ca n't get him to swallow it we 'll shove it up his .  .  .  . 
i forgot my rubber gloves .   let 's do it . 
my equipment does n't crap out .  .  .  . 
no way .  .  .  . 
it 's my fault .  .  . i have to .  .  .  . 
we need it to eat electronics man  .  .  . not you .   get it on me .  .  .  . 
jake . 
i 'm the one who wanted to study it .  .  .  . 
do n't flatter yourself .  .  .  .  
in a few minutes .  .  .  . 
here it comes .  .  .  . 
who grows more beautiful .  .  .  . 
here comes the cow caca .  .  .  . 
more beautiful with each passing minute .  .  . 
i told you .  .  .  . 
now wait a minute .  .  .  i 'm being serious here .  .  .  . 
oh jake .  .  .  
happy birthday darling .   .  .  . 
i just want to make an honest woman of you .  .  .  . 
i 'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair . 
i 'm training to .  .  .  . 
manage the whole damn place some day .  i 'm looking forward to living in the style to which i would like to become accustomed .  .  .  . 
i 'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that .  .  .  . 
as she 's a member of my staff may i ask what this is about ? 
well apparently she saw amber the weekend she left  was briefly in the room with the guy she left with . 
i see  .  .  well she 's teaching an other class at four  .  .  i 'd apprec iate it if you do n't detain her  .  . 
i 'm mr berlin .   mr ross is right here .  and mr ross is maybe gonna take a few notes if that 's o . k .  ?   o . k .   .  .  i 'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want what you can remember about the time you spent with amber on the aft ernoon she left ?  take your time and nothing 's too trivial o . k . 
well i think i told you on the phone  .  .  i went up to her room to say goodbye and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things  .  . 
what kind of friend ?  was he a boy friend ?  an old friend ?  new friend ? 
when we spoke on the phone did you know i was blonde ? 
no . 
why not ?  you heard my voice ? 
i do n't know .  i guess she must have called him john ?  i 'm mak ing tea .  would you like some ? 
no it has a mind of its own . 
my hands ? 
no .  except he smoked .  like you . 
me ? 
yes i could smell it on his breath like i can on your 's . 
no . 
lotta scratchmarks on your door ? 
sometimes i look after friends dogs if they go to dances or something ? 
yes . 
what color was it ? 
i do n't know . 
no just a minute or two  .  .  i knocked on your door  no one home so i followed the music  .  . 
i 'm sorry .  i 'll get my things .

yep .   have a good time at school ray .   wish me luck . 
hi . 
i 'm a little worried 
i 'm worried too .   i 'm worried that the only reason i 'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you were n't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago . 
no . 
hey that 's my word okay ? 
take care okay ?  you 're my entire client roster . 
do n't i know .   now go home to your wife . 
what 's that supposed to mean ? 
why are you even here man ?  you could have told me all this over the phone . 
i do n't know  how 's dedication for an answer ? 
you do n't want to go home do you ? 
why are you doing this to me rod ? 
i 'm asking you a question 
no you 're 
i 'm trying to talk to you .   how 's your marriage ? 
then why 'd you get married ?   i 'm asking you as a friend . 
you 're jabbing at me .   112 . 
no i 'm going to answer you .   you want an answer ?   i 'll give it to you .   loyalty .   she was loyal .   everything grew from there . 
that 's an answer . 
damn right . 
for loyalty you buy a dog .   for love you get married . 
look .   i 'm happy to entertain you as always but i have a question for you .   are we really friends ? 
why not 
well friends can tell each other anything right ?  if we have our friends hats on 
i think so . 
airight .   here 's why you do n't have your ten million dollars yet .  you are a paycheck player .   you play with your head .   not your heart .   in your personal life ?   heart .  but when you get on the field    113 . 
fine . 
beautiful . 
we still having dinner in l . a .  ? 
only cause my wife likes your wife ! 
go .   flee . 
i missed ya .   what can i say ? 
what 
where 'd you find the perfect white shirt ? 
they 're here . 
what ? 
no way .  this is lucky .  couple years ago some buddies and i went hang gliding off these cliffs in new zealand .  updraft sent me right into the side .  boom ! 
that does sound lucky . 
it was this strap alone that saved my life .  got caught on a rock as i was falling . 
reversedarwinism .  survival of the most idiotic . 
the bones will be there when we get back .  that 's the nice thing about them .  they never run away .   and besides you got me into this .  i do n't intend to be alone with these people . 
mr .  and mrs .  kirby !  if you look out the right you can see .  .  . 
i do n't think so . 
obviously a superpredator .   suchimimus .  that snout . 
they never got that big . 
baryonyx ? 
not with that sail .   spinosaurus aegypticus . 
i do n't remember that on ingen's list . 
that 's because it was n't on their list .  who knows what else they were up to ? 
we should take it with us to signal any planes . 
ah yes the first rule of academics .  publish or perish . 
keep going ! 
alan i want to tell you that i 'm so sorry about the .  .  . 
billy i ca n't talk to you now . 
let it go peter .   the animal won . 
do me a favor .   do n't pretend for a second that you and i do n't know the truth .   you can convince time magazine and the skeptical inquirer of whatever you want but i was there . 
you signed a nondisclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw .   you violated that agreement . 
you cost me my livelihood .   that on which i relied to support my children . 
if your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to hard copy i hardly see how i am to
i did n't tell anything i told the truth . 
you version of it . 
there are no versions of the truth !  this is n't a corporate maneuver it 's my life . 
we made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries . 
it was a payoff and an insult .   ingen never
ingen is my livelihood dr .  malcolm and i will jealously defend its interests .   people will know what i want them to know when i want them to know it . 
piss . 
do n't start a legal argument with me this island is n't your property and neither are these animals ! 
oh god . 
do n't ask me .   the guy 's completely out to lunch . 
you 're going too ? 
i lost everything i came after on this trip but one trex in one theme park could singlehandedly bail ingen out of chapter 11 . 
she 's nuts . 
oh my god . 
you ca n't stay kelly that 's it .  it 's too dangerous . 
they were wrong .   case closed .   this thing does n't live in a swamp to support it 's body weight for god 's sake ! 
say again ? 
we were right ! 
how did you do it ?  !   how did you do this ?  ! 
we 're out of a job . 
ca n't we see the unfertilized host eggs ?  ! 
dilophosaurus . 
it 's my favorite . 
i know . 
not just every six weeks . 
yeah i know . 
  the undigested state of the berries because it 's  
  totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern  
no i did n't hear anything .   no we 're okay . 
oh i hate the other kind . 
they 're just doing what they do .   well the other kind      just do what they do . 
dorkatops ! 
i guess we 'll just have to evolve too . 
i 'll stay awake . 
all night ? 
all night . 
it 's okay !   it 's okay !   it 's a brachiosaur ! 
you 're a beautiful big animal . 
well on the tour   the film said they used frog dna to fill in the gene sequence gaps .   they mutated the dinosaur 's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs .   now some west african frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female in a single sex environment .   malcolm was right !   look life found a way ! 
please ! 
bet you 'll never look at birds the same way again ! 
okay .   keep low .   follow me . 
timmy !   the power is coming down quick ! 
i do n't know .  .  .  but i think he 's pissed . 
great .  now there 's two serial killers on the loose . 
krueger 's the greater danger right now .  we have to stop him .   springwood .  that 's where he 'll go .  that 's where he 's always gone . but springwood 's not like crystal lake .  there 's a couple hundred thousand people there .  he could be anywhere . 
i used to go hunting with my father when i was a kid . 
think it 'll do any good ? 
and if he 's not ? 
then we 're all in a lot of trouble . 
neurolar .  it 's a stimulant  it 's also a serotonin inhibitor .  it suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus .  .  .  the part of the brain that controls dreaming . 
so you think it might counteract krueger 's ability to make us hallucinate ? 
ten cc 's of this shit and you wo n't be dreaming about anything . 
how long will the effect last ? 
about ten minutes . 
ten minutes .  .  . 
if i give you a bigger dose it 'll give you a heart attack . 
let 's split up .  you take the left side i 'll take the right .  we 'll meet in front of the cineplex . 
for the moment !  you 've only got about two minutes left !  hurry !  ruby takes off towards the cineplex .  .  . 
my client .  .  .  is dead .   but i think he 's a free man . 
even the socalled new town is n't so new .   only the people .   people of the future living in buildings of the past .   has anyone seen eduard ? 
you have been hearing the sordid side then . 
up there . 
we used to be in the supply section carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them . 
it 's not too bad working here . 
and we 're upset too . 
 how would uyouu like to be in a horrible situation like that ? 
my mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that  not even mentioning accidents  the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip . 
ludwig ? 
here too !   they 're all in a dreadful muddle ! 
they 'd drive us away .   that kafka 's made things very hot for us . 
i understand he was wounded in the lung . 
it does n't matter .   it 's too late for all of us . 
what 's to become of us now ? 
amerika for us ! 
amerika ! 
look mr denham  you 're not welcome here .  just pack up your cameras and go . 
you 're outta your depth here miss darrow ! 
there 's no hard feelings mr denham !  i just want to come to the island with you ! 
does this look like the queen mary ?  ?  we do n't take passengers !  full steam ahead captain engelhorn ! 
you told me what you could .  i guess i 'm through with your part of it . 
is there anything more i could 
i do n't see anything do you ? 
what 're you gonna do next ? 
try some other ways .  
what do i do meanwhile ?   wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me ? 
and i do n't think that was tom . 
you said it was ! 
no i said what did you think . 
oh  wait  oh i get it .  you said that just to keep me scared .  so i 'd tell you everything i  oh clever oh you smart tricky hick .

not much point to this is there ? 
ezra i 'm lots better than you 're used to .  tell me  the other night watching me with mr .  faber  was n't your tongue a little bit hanging out ? 
mm . 
so you 're not too different from him or the chap on the roof or tommybaby 
oh do n't be all hypocrite .  or do you really like other kicks ?  is it more just having power over someone ?   so you do n't really need to 
thanks . 
well what 're you down about ?  you mean because you did n't get me there ?   you ca n't expect that .  i mean frank yes he 'd get me there all the time  but never with a john . 
when ? 
arlyn page . 
did she and jane mckenna know each other ? 
frankie kept them in the same apartment it cut his traveltime . 
then maybe arlyn page knew the dumper too . 
arlyn had a very big habit  heroin  she 's the one who started frank .  she 's strung out now you wo n't find her . 
you could help me find her .  you know the people .   i 'll pay you a hundred dollars . 
i can make that in a lunch break !   look hiram you 're sure it is n't just me ?   you decided you liked it after all the other night you 'll hang around for seconds ? 
do n't worry . 
what the hell do you think 's the matter .   i could wait for you someplace . 
if arlyn page is living with tom grunemann 
 then you do n't need me . 
but if it 's someone else i do . 
how ? 
the same as jane mckenna .

priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who is n't married must be a lesbian .  she figures they 'll be so relieved i 'm a man

tapert .   so now i 've got tapert butterfield . 
tapert 's got nothing to do with this .   he came here to get his palm read .

i think we walk a narrow path between .  .  .  between .  .  . 
heaven and hell ? 
are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real ? 
no .   i 'm saying they were always fake .   the saints the messiahs they were just illusionists . 
so could you walk on water ? 
i could reproduce any miracle that 's ever been performed with a little preparation . 
what about swann's miracles ? 
i heard he was the best . 
if he was so good why 's he so dead ? 
oh i 've got plenty . 
i 'd like to hear them . 
just tell me about swann .   or are you too scared ? 
he was a freak .   everything he did was tainted . 
i know .  but it does n't last you have to go back sometime . 
why ca n't it last ? 
i do n't know it just does n't reality changes things .  .  .  . we ca n't stay here forever unless maybe we started a jazz band .

hello darling . 
lydia i went to this great house tonight this guy designed and built you would have loved it . 
oh yeah ?  i wish i had seen it . 
he was this fashion guy and there were all these japanese fashion people it 's a whole other world and i was talking to these japanese surfers .  .  .  he was playing all this great music i have to find out what it was .  .  . 
that sounds great  can you hold on .  .  .   what zoe ? 
well that 's good i have to get the kids off for school .   can i call you in a little while ? 
it 's four in the morning .  .  .  i 'm going to go to sleep . 
ok well .  .  .  i love you . 
i love you too goodnight or good morning  . 
goodnight . 
i cranked it all the way up .   nothing but hum . 
you 're right .   i must 've made a mistake . 
i had to . 
and this is evil ?   the guy had an aneurysm and now he 's in a coma . 
that 's their explanation .   you might not believe me .  .  . 
well why should i ?   alright what 's your name where do you live when did you kill your parents ? 
peter please .  .  . 
please the children . 
townsend believed just as god became man in christ .   so satan will assume human form .   i believe it too . 
at the exorcism birdson boasted that satan is about to take over the body of a man .   you are that man peter . 
what ?  !  ?  ! 
it 's true .   birdson knew your name he was writing it in numerical code .   it was n't easy but i figured it out .   it spelled your name . 
why did n't birdson just say so ? 
if you 're possessed you ca n't reveal anything satan wants hidden .   unless you trick him . 
trick him . 
the good outwitting the bad .   it 's like birdson had a split personality . 
you should think about getting professional help . 
you 're already contaminated .   it 's why you could n't hear the tape .   there 's probably a pentacle near your bed .   to sanctify you . 
i 'm not going to be drawn into this . 
i know this sounds crazy .   i understand .  check your parents' blood types .   are you sure your parents are your birth parents ? 
my parents are dead .   do n't even think of bringing them into this . 
if you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again .  .  . 
there 's no reason why you should .   this has been planned from your birth .  you fit all the criteria that we know of .   never baptized born of incest devoid of faith .  .  . 
but i was baptized .   and i certainly was n't born of incest . 
you were not baptized .   at least i do n't believe it was christian .   your baptism was performed by your uncle james mckenzie . 
yes i know . 
the only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at bedford . 
so what ? 
seven years .   one baptism ?   he 's your mother 's only brother
yes . 
i looked at the coroner 's report .   my father 's o positive and my mother .  .  . a negative . 
peter your bloodtype is ab negative .  there 's no way your birth father can be o positive .   you father is not who you think he is . 
so .  .  . then the coroner 's report is probably wrong .   i mean .  .  . this is ridiculous .   there 's been a mistake .   i do n't believe any of this . 
then why are you here ? 
uhhuh . 
your sister told me hands off but i ca n't help myself .  .  . 
shh .   it 's okay . 
do n't go starting rumors jim .   my son's college bound with or without basketball . 
you could make a career by telling me where . 
gotta wait til the press conference . 
but you 'd love for him to play at usc like you did . 
i 'd love for him to get a good education .   that 's it . 
it 's okay . 
why are you up ?   get in bed . 
kyra this is monica .   she uh .  .  . 
monica .   you grew up together right ?  quincy 's told me about you . 
yes we appreciate that .

i do n't wanna see that . 
get used to it babe . 
four days . 
why not ? 
you might be the only one with a job . 
baby do n't talk like that .   your rehab 's going well .   you 'll be back before you know it . 
sometimes i wonder if it 's worth it .  busting my ass for what ? 
to do what you love . 
i do n't know sometimes . 
you 're just scared .   i know rehab is hard and you have to worry about whether you 'll be as good as you were but you will be .   i believe in you .   you just have to get back on the court .   like you 'd get back on a horse . 
a horse ? 
do n't make fun of me when i 'm being wonderful and supportive .   you belong on the court .   just like i belong in the stands looking cute and cheering you on . 
no . 
mom 's going to hate it . 
always on my ass anyway . 
like you do n't give her a hard time . 
just cause i do n't kiss her booty like you .  .  . 
just you and quincy baby .   i got a meeting . 
with who ? 
business folks . 
you just got back from a four game road trip . 
nona do n't start bitching .   i got maybe two years left to play .   i 'm just trying to put some things together for us . 
at one in the morning ? 
i 'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife does n't get an attitude . 
i came second to the nba .   i 'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job . 
i 'm just saying it 'd be nice if you found time for your family .  you should see the tramps coming after quincy .   if you do n't talk to him .  .  . 
i have . 
no you said i should get my degree .   i like my bullshit job okay and it 's gonna lead to a spot in the front office .  til then do n't worry there 's just enough savings to keep your ass in gucci and gold . 
keep your voice down . 
what 's that not great ? 
the doctor 'll be back in a minute . 
nona please . 
he tore his acl . 
happy .   and he wo n't want to see you .

it 's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels .  .  . 
 and you wanna know the common element for the entire group like he asks .  .  . i 'll tell you the answer i 'll tell you cause i had that question .   i had that same question .  .  .  . carbon .  in pencil led it 's in the form of graphite and in coal it 's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it 's in hard form .   well .  .  . all we were asking was the common element donnie .  .  . but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge .  .  . ahhh kids !   full of useless thoughts eh ?   thank you .  thank you .   and the book says we may be through with the past but the past is not through with us .   and no it 's not dangerous to do that . 
do n't donnie .  do n't do it .

i said i 'm fine . 
if the young woman truly loves raoul 
she 's a woman d 'artagnan !   from a poor family .   you may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything but i am old and hard and i 've seen too much .   even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire because power seduces even more than love ! 
i fear i know our king .   i came to try to bring you hope . 
what hope is there ?   a wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king and what chance is there of that ?   fromberge is on the battle line and raoul 
i have dispatches a message to fromberge requesting that raoul be kept far from the fighting . 
raoul is everything to me . 
i know . 
oh my friend . 
you trust his character more than anyone else does . 
raoul is hurrying to the front so i must hurry too . 
save my son d 'artagnan . 
get out of my way . 
athos i beg you 
to kill the king . 
the king killed my son ! 
the cannons killed raoul !   the cannons and love .   but not the king . 
an oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed ! 
why do you follow him d 'artagnan ?  !  i know you have put service above your own life but why does this king deserve such loyalty ?   he is a monster !   he executes ministers for his own blunders with their families hostage so they take the blame !   he has no honor ! 
no man is all bad .  .  .  or all good .   i believe  i must believe  that louis can learn .   and perhaps i can help him . 
i cannot athos .   dearly as i love you i cannot . 
i came to see you safely out .   check for yourself . 
perhaps not as much as you might imagine .   when tutors answered every question except those about who i was .   when i was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been i knew there was something different about me .   but a king .  .  . 
phillippe .  .  .  there is something i hope you understand .   terrible cruelty has been used against you .  and .  .  .  you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it . 
there is .  .  .  wrath .  .  .  in me .   i have learned to hide it .   those years in the cell i dreamed that freedom would someday just happen the way the mask happened .   now i am free .  and with each free breath i feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all i lost .   look at this all this that for ten years i could not see !   what if i become a king  a king no different from my brother ? 
the desire for vengeance .  .  .  can be a poison . 
what is its antidote ? 
i suppose .  .  .  it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison who pass such beauty every day and never see it . 
could explain why fleming was there .

we 've been notified that they rejected the sentence .  .  . 
billy !   please !

oh so i 'm the bad guy now ? 
fine then i 'm the bad guy .  jesus ! 
no such thing baby . 
fuck em .   they do n't know what they 're missing . 
right . 
i was just late . 
susan we 're not b
you said that thing was big as your hand .   i do n't think i 'm going to miss .  .  . 
why take the chance ?   just let me go down there with you .  .  . 
no . 
it did n't bite me . 
i know .   but if it was carrying something .  .  . there 's a chance you could have been exposed . 
yeah barely .  we have n't found anything down here .  nothing .  .  . 
i do n't know it 's weird but a couple of broken bones has n't done a lot for my creative juices .  get the fuck out of here . 
do n't talk to me like that . 
why what are you going to do ?   kill me ?  take your best shot . 
why are you so mean mister you 'dbe deadinthesnowifitwas n'tfor me ? 
oh no reason you keep me prisoner you make me burn my book you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles .  .  . 
i 'll drive a sledgehammer into your mangland if you 're not nicer
be my guest . 
that 's disgusting . 
but the time is now .  soon others will come . 
it 's almost done .  by dawn we 'll be able to give misery back to the world . 
three more chapters to go . 
maybe . 
this is so exciting .  it 's windthorne her first love right ? 
maybe .  are you ready for the next chapter ? 
i 'm glad you like it . 
paul this will be our legacy . 
it will . 
you 'll know very soon .  i 'm starting the last chapter .  and when i finish i want everything to be perfect .  i 'll require three things . 
what things ? 
you do n't know ? 
i was fooling silly .   you need a cigarette because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book and you just have one and the match is to light it .  and you need one glass of champagne .   dome peariggnon . 
dome peariggnon it is . 
i 'm almost done . 
oh paul this is so romantic .  ian and windthorne dueling for the right to misery 's hand .  does ian win ?  oh do n't me .  it 's windthorne right ? 
you 'll know everything in a minute .  get the champagne . 
ahh !  !  ! 
you did perfect .  except for one thing .  this time we need two glasses . 
work work work .   virginia ?  when was that blizzard ? 
four or five days ago .  why ? 
well this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the sheriff . 
i 'd like a little more conviction .  . 
so would i .   but it 's not mine to give . 
you 've either got it or you do n't .   let your conscience be your guide ? 
something like that . 
you can be a thief and have a conscience . 
no .   you can be a thief and have a conscience  not me .   why did you have to tell me about this !   what do i have to do to get away from this guy ?   when you 're with him he messes about with your head every waking moment .  . even now i 'll be at some outof thewayplace a tin of caviar and a bottle of crystal shows up at the table with two glass god knows how he finds out at any given moment where i am in the world but he does .   and it looks like he 's done it again .   you know his definition of a  true paranoid ? 
i do n't . 
someone in possession of all the facts .   are you telling me i have to do this ? 
generally i do n't favor coercing someone .  not when there 's a chance my life could end up in their hands . 
and that 's the only reason ? 
can you think of a better one ? 
not me .   i was just hoping you might .  . or that .  . somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical . 
look would it make you feel better if i did n't want you to do this ? 
much . 
then feel better !  .  . 
what would n't make him suspicious ? 
probably that i needed him in some urgent way .  . destitute  in serious trouble .  . the kind i could n't possible sort out myself .  . 
this does n't seem to be accomplishing much . 
well i mean it 's not a total loss .   it is keeping a very capable thief off the street .  . 
very funny .  . maybe he has heard and does n't want to know .   maybe he 's lost interest . 
how can you possibly ?   i 've got to get right on the plane .   i 'm leaving now . 
you do n't trust me . 
oh i do .   but as we know i 'm a very poor judge of character . 
he 's got you on qantas flight 2735 .   it 's going to be delayed . 
yes ? 
you 'll be fine .   i 'm going to lose you . 
ethan you take care of yourself i 'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove i 'm gonna bail  and without giving two week notice . 
well forewarned is forearmed .   and while we 're at it be especially sensitive to any sudden change in ambrose 's plans especially any involving you .  .

that 's right .   max it seems has two unique gifts  a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents .  this time he 's gotten to someone on the inside  he 's put himself in a position to buy our noc list .  an operation he referred to as job 314 .   the job he thought golitsyn was doing tonight . 
but the list golitsyn stole was a decoy . 
correct the actual list is safe at langley .   golitsyn was a lightning rod one of ours . 
this whole operation was a molehunt . 
yes the mole 's deep inside .  and  like you said .   you survived . 
how about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and i wash your mouth out with soap  you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole . 
ethan i can understand you 're very upset . 
kitteridge you 've never seen me very upset . 
i see you 've been out visiting the folks . 
it 's hunt .   what do you need for a pinpoint ?   been watching a little t . v .  have you ? 
certainly ethan . 
if you 're dealing with someone who 's crushed stabbed shot and detonated five members of his own imf team how devastated do you think you 're going to make him by marching ma and uncle donald down to the county courthouse ? 
i do n't know ethan .  suppose you tell me ? 
information . 
what kind ? 
profitable . 
there was never any physical evidence that i had anything to do with that .  .  that .  .   with that exceptional piece of work . 
you do n't know what you 're missing .  this is the mt .  everest of hacks . 
you 're all kidding yourselves .  even with top of the line crypto .   cray access .  stu 3 's 
thinking machine laptops i 'm talking about the 686 prototypes  uwithu the artificial intelligence risk chip 
luther i guess you 're all out of excuses . 
i ca n't just hack my way inside .   there 's no modem access to the mainframe it 's in a standalone .   i 'd have to be physically at the terminal . 
luther relax it 's worse than you think .  the terminal 's in black vault lockdown . 
now i want you to hold onto it . 
what makes you trust me ? 
because if you knew what you were getting into you never would have done it . 
i 'm not letting this list get out in the open . 
exactly that 's your job .   tomorrow on the train you ca n't let this list get out into the open .   what 's the range of this thing ? 
it 's hard to tell .   i 'm gonna have to be close . 
i 'll get you close .

i was raised that a girl gets married young .  i did n't get married until i was twentyeight .  i met a man .  i loved him .  i married him .  he wanted to have a baby right away .  i said no .  then he got hit by a bus .  no man .  no baby .  no nothing !  i did not know that man was a gift i could not keep .  i did n't know .  .  .  you tell me a story and you think you know what it means but i see what the true story is and you ca n't .   she did n't leave you !  you ca n't see what you are .  i can see everything .  you are a wolf ! 
i 'm a wolf ? 
the big part of you has no words and it 'sa wolf .  this woman was a trap for you .  she caught you and you could not get away .   so you chewed off your foot !  that was the price you had to pay to be free .   johnny had nothing to do with it .  you did what you had to do between you and you and i know i 'm right i do n't care what you say .  and now you 're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love .  that 's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman .  you are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again ! 
what are you doing ! 
i 'm telling you your life ! 
stop it ! 
no ! 
why are you marrying johnny ?  he 's a fool ! 
because i have no luck ! 
he made me look the wrong way and i cut off my hand .  he could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head ! 
i am looking where i should to become a bride ! 
a bride without a head ! 
a wolf without a foot ! 
where are you taking me ? 
to the bed . 
oh .  oh god .  i do n't care about anything .  i do n't care about anything !  take me to the bed . 
me neither . 
i was dead . 
i was dead too . 
all my life i have never reached a man .  i knew that i would reach my husband but i took my time and he was dead .  ronny . 
loretta . 
i want to cut you open and crawl inside of you .  i want you to swallow me . 
i 've got you . 
get all of me .  take everything . 
what about johnny ? 
you 're mad at him take it out on me take your revenge on me !  take everything leave nothing for him to marry !  hollow me out so there 's nothing left but the skin over my bones .  suck me dry ! 
alright .  alright .  there will be nothing left . 
sure . 
good night . 
you mean the whole house ? 
yes . 
my god it 's a mansion ! 
it 's a house . 
i live in a onebedroom apartment .  what exactly does your husband do ? 
he 's a plumber . 
well .  that explains it . 
marriage is happy news . 
what ?  what ? 
look . 
oh . 
it 's cosmo 's moon . 
what are you talking about raymond ?  cosmo ca n't own the moon . 
i mean it 's that moon i was talking about at dinner .   is he down there ?  no . 
is who down there ? 
cosmo . 
what would he be doing down there ? 
i do n't know . 
you know in this light and with that expression on your face you look about twentyfive years old . 
you were a tiger last night . 
and you were a lamb .  as soft as milk . 
shut up .  they 'll hear you in the back . 
so what ?  the pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you do n't worry about nothing .  hey how about a date tonight rita .  let 's eat pasta and roll around . 
raymond raymond lower your voice !  what 's got into you ? 
i do n't know !  that moon !  that crazy moon cosmo sent over ! 
you see that moon last night ? 
oh .  right . 
i knew she had it . 
we never suspected you ! 
shut up !   you only killed the bride 's father  that 's all 
i was saved at the last minute . 
how ? 
well  .  .  .  i 'll tell you  .  .  . 
not  .  .  .  to leave the room  .  .  .  even if you come and get him . 
no .   until i come and get him . 
 .  .  .  and you 'll come and get him . 
leaving the room . 
leaving the room  .  .  .  yes . 
got it ? 
yes ? 
if we  .  .  .  er  .  .  .  
look it 's  simple .   just stay here and make sure he does n't leave the room . 
no  .  .  .  .   keep him in here  .  .  .  and make sure he does n't  .  .  . 
oh yes !   we 'll keep him in here obviously .   but if he had to leave and we were with him . 
no  .  .  .  just keep him in here . 
until you or anyone else  .  .  . 
no not anyone else  just me . 
just you  .  .  . 
okay .   fine .   we 'll remain here until you get back . 
and make sure he does n't leave .

make sure he does n't leave . 
the prince  .  .  .   ? 
yes  .  .  .   make sure  .  .  . 
oh yes of course !   i thought you meant him !   you know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he 's a guard  .  .  . 
is that clear ? 
we 're coming with you . 
no i want you to stay here and make sure he does n't leave the room until i get back . 
oh i see  right . 
yes .   it 's not a very good name is it ?   but we are nice and we shall attend to your every  .  .  .  every need ! 
er  .  .  .        you are the keepers of the holy grail ? 
the what ?   but you are tired and you must rest awhile .   midget !  crapper ! 
sir henry is not alone .   they all wish it .   the same people who refused to grant my husband the title of king because he was deemed of insufficient rank
aye ma 'am . 
yes . 
what ? 
those over there there . 
craobhangeanmchnofhiadhaich . 
craobhangeanmchno .  .  .   how can i possibly say that with a straight face ?  ! 
are they worth reading ? 
i am told so . 
who by ? 
sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming . 
what does he know about the highlands ? 
he has been attending at balmoral for many years . 
that does n't make him an expert . 
his remarks were directed at the quality of the writing not its subject . 
i do n't groom a horse to have it admired by others i groom it because it needs grooming . 
i do not do it for others .   but ponsonby thinks they are good . 
just say what you have to say woman .  what other people think should n't matter to you . 
of course i shall say what i have to say .   i always do . 
what mr ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming .   literary appreciation does not begin and end with tennyson . 
i hope they did n't go to any trouble john . 
ah well .  .  . 
to keep out the cold . 
aye . 
i heard something . 
i ordered it .   it 's for your own safety . 
dear me you 'll be telling me to watch what i eat next . 
aye .   but there are fenians reported on the mainland . 
the threat from the irish is greatly exaggerated i 'm sure . 
i 'll decide when it 's exaggerated . 
and beat it at it 's own game . 
you realize that in order to do that we 'd actually have to play the game . 
i was afraid you 'd say that . 
drives em crazy every time . 
no i 'm not .  .  . 
we 're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer learn some tricks and stuff .  .  .   i mean you do n't want us kids running around school saying your game 's too hard right ? 
what are you going to do ? 
get that helmet .   if we 're going to play arcade i want every advantage possible . 
i ca n't believe you made it ! 
everything . 
dante 's inferno . 
yeah .   the inferno . 
you did n't hear me ? 
a way to hook this helmet into the game .  i 'm sure there are interfaces .  .  . 
put in a quarter . 
it can turn itself on alex !   it does n't need a quarter . 
yes it does .   do n't you see ?   we have to play by the rules .   that 's what it wants . 
not that i can see . 
we 'll take our check . 
maybe it 's not me . 
call the number . 
maybe the voice is n't diane selwyn .  maybe that 's your roommate or if it is diane selwyn she can tell you who you are . 
maybe .  .  . maybe  .  .  .  maybe . 
i 'm not sure about this . 
i know you 're afraid of something .  we 'll be careful .  tomorrow we 'll go over there and we 'll find out . 
i came back .  i thought that 's what you wanted . 
my parents are right upstairs !  they think you 've left .  .  . 
so .  .  .  surprise .  .  . 
i can call them .  .  .  i can call my dad .  .  .  
but you wo n't .  .  . 
you know what i want .  .  . it 's not that difficult . 
get out !  get out before i call my dad  .  .  .  he trusts you  .  .  .  your his best friend .  this will be the end of everything .  .  .  
what about you ?  what will your dad think about you ? 
stop !  just stop !  that 's what you said from the beginning .  if i tell what happened .  .  .  they 'll arrest you and put you in jail so get out of here before .  .  . 
before what ? 
then they 'd put you in jail . 
i 'm all right . 
you 've got to eat something .  you 're just nervous about going over to see if you 're diane selwyn . 
here .  am i ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers  ? 
when i think you 're ready . 
when will that be  ? 
when you are ready . 
look you 're going to have to start trusting me sometime .  i am a trustworthy person . 
trust is earned not given away . 
respect is earned not given away trust is given away to anybody . 
not down here .  i 'll start trusting you when i feel there the time is right .  it 's not personal it 's just survival . 
i 've been working with you for four years do n't you think that 's worthy of at least one turn at the controls  ? 
no . 
and who bailed you out when a hit was put on you you sorry sack of shit .  who put you up  ?  who gave you a job  ? 
you did . 
that 's right .  now who needs to trust who  ?  trust me when you 're ready to work the controls i 'll put you in the hot seat . 
i just want to double check the facts . 
so  ? 
he already had a balance of 600000 . 
he probably has a history of this shit . 
yeah maybe .  .  .  .  let 's start the background checks .  let 's see where they live and what kind of security systems .  .  .  . 
matthew lives on the upper west side kinda posh for a temp do n't you think  ? 
any priors  ?  any police record  ? 
checking .  .  .  .  .  hah  !  he has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets .  .  . 
parking tickets  ?  that 's it  ? 
yeah but we 're talking 43 . 
a real criminal .  .  .  .  i still think that 's our in .  .  .  what about her  ? 
checking .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
i 'm sick of playing .  i 've got a better idea . 
for once in your life shut the fuck up . 
fire the whole division . 
excuse me sir  ? 
fire the whole division .  we 're moving more of the operations division into manhattan anyway .  whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed .  we already have all the key people here .  anyone else is expendable . 
sir i came from the chicago offices myself and if i may say sir there are still some very good .  .  .  . 
if you want i can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people .  which will it be  ? 
we will start work on it now sir . 
not that well sir .  i believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building .  did we aquire a bank from chicago or a charity  ? 
relax son .  they 'll learn in time that you do n't fuck with first bank .  this is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong .  my daddy always told me that only the strong survive . 
i thought that was darwin sir .  or perhaps nietzsche  ? 
perhaps it was .  i was in boarding school for so many years it 's hard to remember .  do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby  ? 
yes sir i do .  last night 's fresh from the park . 
i have to say that i am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass . 
thank you  sir .  sir may i ask you a question  ? 
of course . 
while i am not morally against these little shall we say hobbies as long as i am on the payroll but why not something like a yacht club  ? 
zach how old are you son  ? 
i am thirty two . 
and how much do we pay you annually  ? 
i make roughly four hundred thousand a year . 
zach my boy i can spend your yearly salary in a blink .  i have had that kind of money all of my life .  if i wanted to i could fly to paris for the afternoon .   my father formed this company over seventy years ago .  when my brother became mentally challenged it was put in my charge .  now running a bank of this size is very stressful .  i need to relax on what little down time i have .  a yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline .  understand  ? 
yes sir . 
i have entrusted you with a great many things .  in your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live .  i think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded . 
thank you sir . 
son let 's watch the tape . 
i had suggested that they tone down the program so that the guests might take longer to expire . 
i want more action .  i want to see more ingenuity than that .  i want to see the injured man out wit the machines  ! 
but sir most of the people we are putting into the park are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers .  they are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess . 
i do n't believe ol' bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did .  he still insists on the guests being of the more nefarious type . 
that 's right sir .  he does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement then he will put them in the park .  he has refused the last three suggested guests . 
what about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the park  ?  was n't that a computer glitch  ? 
yes sir .  it turns out we put an innocent man into the park and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine .  that is also about the time when bruce began refusing . 
that mail room kid was the longest lasting guest yet  !  maybe we can alter the computer records and make another guest from the more athletic of our staff . 
bruce may still refuse .  it is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent . 
of course . 
i think that if i 'm old enough to accept a new baby and if i 'm old enough to accept a new room i 'm old enough to go to california . 
honey i know it 's fun to think about these things but .  .  .  . 
i already bought a ticket . 
what ?  ? 
i used my own money and got a great deal it 's a q47nr five day fare which means that i have to change planes in dallas and stay over a saturday . 
and no boys promise me oh those la people are all so corrupt you 'll end up pregnant and on drugs .  .  . and do n't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer .  .  . and do n't make eye contact it communicates an implied vulnerability . 
it means .  .  . i 'm a paranoid nitwit who 's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he 's a paranoid nitwit .  so why do n't you just say quotoh dadquot and get on the damn plane already ? 
thanks i needed that . 
i 'll be back in 137 hours . 
have fun . 
hi dad . 
hi honey . 
i just called to say that i 'm having a really great time . 
good !  you should go over and watch some ted carson . 
actually i wanna see jeffrey pommeroy . 
totally groovy huh ? 
totally . 
ask him if he needs a good tuba player . 
i will .  how 's shelly ? 
oh she 's fine .  .  . ahh .  .  . umm the doctor just .  .  . ehh .  .  . told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and .  .  . n stay quiet .  .  . just .  .  . just to make sure that .  .  . 
okay .  .  . bye daddy i love you . 
i love you too sweetie bye .

if i eat it i 'll throw up . 
well you should at least try a little bit . 
then i 'll throw up a little bit . 
vada i wanna ask you a favor remember you can absolutely say no if you want to . 
look we react to every kick this baby gives maybe vada 's trying to tell us something too . 
that 's ridiculous i 'm .  .  . i 'm very umm what do you call it ? 
committed ? 
committed . 
so does that mean that you sleep here every night ? 
yes it does . 
vada i know that traditionally you 're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you 're officially married .  .  . but these are very very special circumstances . 
i 'll do better than that .  i 'll send you off with your own private guide . 
bye . 
do n't worry i 'll do it in my own subtle way . 
how 's this for a solution .  we 'll take a drive over to his place you can introduce yourself .  .  .  . 
i 'd like to see his house but .  .  . i do n't know if i 'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door .  i do n't think i can go through with it . 
then we 'll keep driving .  .  . you 'll decide . 
i do n't know he 's got an awful lot on his mind right now . 
then again your dad 's got his own memories and he 's got his own life now .  .  . i think this is a secret just between you and your mom . 
a secret i like that . 
this is it i guess . 
well i 've come this far .  .  . the least i can do is knock on the door . 
you want me to come with ? 
i should do this myself . 
okay .  .  . take your time .  .  . i 'll .  .  . i 'll go for a walk around . 
okay . 
dad already gave me this lecture .  he 's gonna meet me at the airport then we 'll go for some pizza then we 'll have dinner in bed with shelly .

jos  maybe you should turn it down . 
i just ca n't look at you the same way .

billy prince is asking you to prom . 
why ? 
i do n't know . 
the poem !  i knew he liked the poem !   billy prince is asking me to the prom . 
that 's what i 'm saying . 
i know like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid . 
nah uh . 
it 's really hard to do .  some kids try for all ofhigh school and never make it . 
we 're very evolved . 
who are you guys ? 
you so do not deserve to be prom queen . 
i 'm handing out a free lei to every customer !  what do you think ? 
i think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches . 
change is scary .  robbie let me tell you a little something about the mail business .  i 've been in it over thirty years .  and in those thirty years the only thing that 's changed is the elvis stamp and some gun laws .  people are bored !  they wanna shake things up ! 
i thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time . 
what do you mean ? 
i thought you might be able to make a connection . 
c 'mon cut it out . 
well what am i supposed to do ? 
i do n't know .   concentrate or some thing . 
shhh .   just concentrate . 
uhuh .   wait .  .  . 
about what ? 
about not finding any bogey men ? 
i 'll get over it . 
maybe it only happens when you 're sleeping  that 's the way it was with nancy was n't it ? 
now there 's an idea we can take off on .   maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and .  .  .   until i fall asleep . 
maybe we can do that .   strictly scientific of course . 
ghostbusters are fearless . 
whoa ! 
what is it ? 
i do n't know  a sharp pain . 
oh jesse .  .  . 
i 'm fine .   nothing 's wrong . 
you did n't say more than two words to me the whole way here .   you had another nightmare did n't you ? 
yeah i had a bad night . 
you want to talk about it ? 
my dad thinks i 'm on drugs my mom thinks i 'm crazy and i 'm not sure i do n't agree with her . 
just go .   kristen needs you .   keep her awake somehow .   do it . 
your dreams ? 
hey everybody has bad dreams . 
freddy krueger .   he was a child murderer before he died .   after he died he became  .  .  . something worse .   six years ago freddy killed my friends .  he almost killed me .   i thought i got rid of him  but i guess he was too strong . 
sshhh .   no time for that .   come on . 
what about kristen ? 
we ca n't get to her .   i 've tried . 
and what are they ? 
the byproduct of guilt .   psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality . 
you ca n't !   they 'll be defenseless against their dreams . 
that 's precisely what they need .   some uninterrupted rem sleep to release all this negative energy . 
neil please 
how do we get in ? 
they used to keep a spare key . 
what are you talking about ? 
you 're about to attend a funeral .   one that 's long overdue . 
what ? 
listen . 
i mean  today 's newspapers will be lining tomorrow 's waste paper bins . 
excuse me ? 
well you know  it 's just one day .  today 's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow . 
you really do n't get it .   this story gets filed .   every time anyone writes anything about me  they 'll dig up these photos .   newspapers last forever .  i 'll regret this forever . 
i only found out you were here yesterday . 
i was going to ring .  .  .  but .  .  .  i did n't think you 'd want to .  .  . 
absolutely  you 're clearly very busy . 
but .  .  .  wait .  .  .  there are things to say . 
okay . 
drink tea  there 's lots of tea . 
hello . 
you disappeared . 
yes  i 'm sorry  i had to leave .  .  .  i did n't want to disturb you . 
well .  .  .  how have you been ? 
fine .   everything much the same .   when they change the law spike and i will marry immediately .   whereas you .  .  .  i 've watched in wonder .   awards glory  .  .  . 
oh no .   it 's all nonsense believe me .  i had no idea how much nonsense it all was  but nonsense it all is .  .  .   well yesterday was our last day filming and so i 'm just off  but i brought you this from home and .  .  . 
thank you .   shall i .  .  . 
no do n't open it yet  i 'll be embarrassed . 
okay  well thank you .   i do n't know what it 's for .   but thank you anyway . 
i actually had it in my apartment in new york and just thought you 'd .  .  .  but when it came to it i did n't know how to call you .  .  .  having behaved so .  .  .  badly twice .   so it 's been just sitting in the hotel .   but then .  .  .  you came so i figured .  .  .  the thing is .  .  .  the thing is  .  .  . 
what 's the thing ? 
yes .   the thing is .  .  .  i have to go away today but i wondered if i did n't whether you might let me see you a bit .  .  .  or a lot maybe .  .  .  see if you could .  .  .  like me again . 
you expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in england ? 
that 's fine .   there 's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict . 
 .  .  .  yes that 's fine .   of course .   i .  .  .  you know .  .  .  of course .  .  .  i 'll just .  .  .  be getting along then .  .  .  nice to see you . 
the truth is .  .  . 
i see .   that reality is a real no' is n't it ? 
i live in notting hill .   you live in beverly hills .   everyone in the world knows who you are .   my mother has trouble remembering my name . 
okay .   fine .   fine .   good decision . 
three . 
yes . 
oh .   right . 
i 'm sorry .   which hospital ? 
oh sure .   of course . 
fabulous . 
wait a minute  she took your grandmother 's flowers ? 
yes . 
bad news . 
what ? 
we 've got a security camera in this bit of the shop . 
so ? 
so i saw you put that book down your trousers . 
what book ? 
the one down your trousers . 
i have n't got a book down my trousers . 
right  well then we have something of an impasse .   i tell you what  i 'll call the police  andwhat can i say ?   if i 'm wrong about the whole bookdownthetrousers scenario i really apologize . 
okay  what if i did have a book down my trousers ? 
well ideally when i went back to the desk you 'd remove the cadogan guide to bali from your trousers and either wipe it and put it back or buy it .   see you in a sec . 
yes that 's perfectly correct . 
he also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere but he did n't say how .  he has been heard to say to his wife i hate you i do n't ever want to see you again .  you 've betrayed me .  so .  does anyone care to touch upon this further ? 
yes miss ratched this is correct . 
but you have no proof . 
no miss ratched .  .  . 
and yet you suspect her . 
yes that is correct . 
why ? 
i can only speculate as to the reasons why . 
have you ever speculated mister harding that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements ? 
i mean the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having .  i know that to be the case but the way in which you broached it if that 's your idea of teaching me something .  .  . 
yes thank you miss ratched .  since our last meeting i have been reflecting quite seriously on the nature of my problem .  naturally i 'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain .  .  .  no no .  to personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function .  .  .   regardless of the function we will confront the question of .  .  .  yes .  yes .  the question of .  .  .  existence .  .  .  relationship .  .  .  function .  .  .  confront .  .  .  yes confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis .  .  .  yes the crisis of our souls .  of our souls which i am trying to fully understand the problem .  .  .  the problem .  not to shut ourselves off but somehow .  .  .  somehow to understand fully our capacity .  .  .  to obtain .  .  .  to personify .  .  .  the question .  .  .  existence depends .  .  .  depends on the question .  .  .  to reflect .  .  .  to reflect .  .  . 
my feet hurt .  .  . 
lemme see .  .  .

your buddy is callin' ya . 
i 'm seeing what a busy man does .

what ? 
reptilian swine .   there 's no such thing .   reptiles are n't swine . 
who cares ?  !   you hired an actor ?  ? 
i do n't know what you 're talking about .   who told you that ? 
no one had to tell me .   he 's starring in the local play . 
i ca n't believe you did that ! 
and i ca n't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger some phantom you 've never even met destroy it . 
you 're the reason i never met him .  you knew it was the thing i most wanted in life and you sabotaged it . 
i sabotaged it ?   you 're the one who lost him remember ? 
well i might 've found him again if i had n't left rome to make this pointless trip down here with you . 
as i recall you were on your way home .   and i did n't want you to go so yes i told you a little white lie . 
a little white lie ?   a little white lie ? 
what would you call it ? 
i would call it unforgivable . 
rational ?  !   love is not rational !  are you crazy ? 
yes .   i 'm crazy .   you have driven me crazy .   no one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you .   did it ever even for one second occur to you how much work it was to set all this up ?   how many arrangements had to be made ?  how many players had to be coordinated ? 
gee i 'm flattered .   what an incredibly romantic gesture .  cancel the roses i 've decided to lie to her instead . 
very funny . 
no it is n't .   i called off my wedding all because of you . 
yes . 
uh huh . 
i did n't expect you back so soon . 
actually no .   there 's not going to be a wedding . 
oh . 
and larry ?  .  .  . 
what about larry ? 
i do n't know .   i 've just been thinking .  .  .  maybe this destiny thing is more of a doityourself operation .   maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for . 
he 's gone .   he told me what happened .   he just left for the airport . 
larry did you rent a car ? 
kate . 
you are looking for a place to stay no kate ? 
no .   well i do n't know .   well maybe .   later .

oh hello .   i just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink but
i 'd love to .

a bum .  look what you 're doing .  you want to be brave ?  firing lead into another man's flesh is n't brave .  any bum who picks up a  . 45 in a pawn shop can be that brave .  you want to hurt johnny friendly ?  you want to fix him for what he did to charley and a dozen men who were better than charley ?  do n't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle .  that 's just what he wants .  he 'll hit you in the head and plead selfdefense .  fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it  truth is the gun drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little   cap pistol . 
johnny friendly is layin' odds that you wo n't get up . 
i can ?  okay .   okay .  .  . 
have a seat .  i 'm trying to find out just what happened to joey doyle .  maybe you can help .

yeah considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball ! 
nice fellows . 
those blood suckers .  how i 'd love to fix those babies but
but you still hold out for silence ? 
are you on the level father ? 
what do you think ? 
if i stick my neck out and they chopped it off would that be the end of it ?  or are you ready to go all the way ? 
i 'll go down the line kayo believe me . 
baseball bats that 's just for openers .  they 'll put the muscle on you turnedaround collar or no turnedaround collar . 
and i still say you stand up and i 'll stand up with you . 
down to the wire ? 
so help me god ! 
well i had my fun i 've drunk my fill and i tickled some goodlookin' fillies i 'm on borried time . 
what about it ? 
i thought i recognized you .  saw you fight in st .  nick 's a couple of years ago . 
o . k .  o . k .  without the bird seed .  what do you want ? 
our identification . 
we 're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions . 
i do n't know nothing . 
they did n't itelli me anything they asked questions . 
but you know what i 'm talking about do n't you ?   about glenn do n't you and the second car ? 
i know a glenn . 
no thanks . 
you mean did he try to jump me ?   no but he was kind of talkative . 
he gets that way when he 's nervous sometimes . 
he did n't want me to . 
why not ? 
i do n't know .   he was different after he was sentenced looking at thirty years .   said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer . 
but you spoke to him on the phone . 
he 'd call every once in a while . 
he called the day he escaped . 
he did ?   i do n't remember .   did he say about me ?   in the trunk ? 
he said he wished the two of you could start over live a normal life . 
huh .   problem is jack 's idea of a normal life is robbing banks .   it 's all he 's ever done . 
did you know that when you married him ? 
he said he was a card player .   i could live with that .   i never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire  if you can imagine something like that happening comes out of the bank and the car 's on fire .  i did go see him in jail to tell him i was filing for divorce .   he said okay .   jack 's so easy going .   he was fun but never what you 'd call a real husband . 
really .   hm . 
buddy 'll take care of him .   keep him out 've trouble .   he 's jack 's conscience .  always has been .   he tell you how they met ? 
till they got busted . 
that was n't jack 's fault .   no that was on account of buddy for some reason decided to call his sister and confess to a job ubeforeu they 'd done it instead of after .   she called the fbi and they both went down ended up at lompoc .   i think buddy felt kinda bad about that . 
any idea where i could find buddy ?   or glenn ? 
who are you ? 
thank you . 
yes . 
not until recently . 
nervous ? 
a little . 
this kind of setup you do n't have any idea what the fuck you 're doing  do you ? 
you 're right .   so why take a chance
i 'm a federal marshal and you 're under arrest both of you guys . 
if i could have a little more room . 
there is n't any .   all this shit you got in here .   what is all this stuff anyway ?   handcuffs chains .  .  .  what 's this can ? 
for your breath .   you could use it .  squirt some in your mouth . 
you devil it 's mace huh ?   what 've you got here a billy ?   use it on poor unfortunate offenders . 
in my bag in the car . 
i believe it .   you 've ruined a nine hundreddollar suit my dad gave me . 
yeah went real nice with that twelve gauge too .   tell me why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall ? 
the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me . 
guys like me huh .   well listen even though i 've been celibate lately i 'm not gonna force myself on you .   i 've never done that in my life . 
you would n't have time anyway .   we come to a roadblock they 'll run the car find out in five seconds who it belongs to . 
if they get set up in time which i doubt .   and even if they do they 'll be looking for a buncha little latin fellas not a big black guy driving a ford . 
must be quite a pal risk his own ass like this . 
buddy .   that 's his given name ? 
one i gave him yeah .   fuck .  .  . 
jack foley .   you 've probably heard of me . 
why are you famous ? 
time i was convicted in california ?  fbi told me i 'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer . 
how many was that ? 
tell you the truth i do n't know .   i started when i was eighteen driving for my uncle cully and his partner gus .   they go into a bank this one time in slidell gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg .  all three of us ended up in angola . 
that 's funny . 
i thought so too . 
it was me i woulda left ol' gus on the floor . 
i believe you would have .   another fall i did seven years at lompoc .   and i do n't mean the place next door where some of nixon's people went . 
i know the difference .   you were in lompoc usp the federal penitentiary .  i 've delivered people there .   so basically you 've spent half your life in prison . 
basically .   yeah .   if i go back now i do a full thirty years no time off .  can you imagine looking at that ? 
i do n't have to .   i do n't rob banks . 
of course i am . 
you do n't act like it . 
what do you want me to do ?   scream ?   i do n't think it would help much .   i 'm just gonna sit back take it easy and wait for you to screw up . 
jesus you sound like my exwife . 
you were married ?   all those falls i 'm surprised you had time . 
it was just a year give or take a few days .   i mean it 's not like we did n't get along or anything .   we had fun we just did n't have that .  .  .  that thing you know ?   that spark you know what i mean ?   you gotta have that . 
uhhuh . 
we still talk though . 
sure . 
yeah well if it turns out i get shot like a dog it 'll be in the street not off a goddamn fence . 
you must see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow . 
i do n't recall his hat but i 've seen pictures of him lying dead shot by texas rangers .   did you know he did n't have his shoes on ? 
is that right ? 
they put a hundred and eightyseven bullet holes in clyde bonnie parker and the car they were driving .   bonnie was eating a sandwich .

then they 're not separated are they ? 
can we change the subject ? 
what 're you doing at glades ? 
serving process a summons and complaint .   some con doing mandatory life does n't like macaroni and cheese .  he files suit says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights . 
you know you can always step in work with me fulltime as one of my investigators . 
no thanks . 
you used to like it . 
dad .  .  . 
you 'd meet doctors lawyers  nothing wrong with them necessarily if they 're divorced .   why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife ?   that 's the way those hotshots are all of em . 
i really gotta go . 
we do n't get to talk much any more . 
how bout i come next sunday and watch the super bowl with you ? 
i 'd like that .

he 's pretty laid back confident . 
he remind you of that guy tillman ? 
not at all . 
but you know he 's dirty and you still wanna see him again . 
i want to bust his ass put him in shackles . 
maybe .   but you 're also curious about the man .   twice last night you asked your married boyfriend nicolet about him .   you were concerned but you did n't want to show it . 
my married boyfriend  setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity .   i could n't believe it . 
you like the wild ones do n't you ?  tillman nicolet and now foley .   you know i 've always said there 's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers all those guys that love to pack . 
foley ikidinapped me . 
yeah but you talked all the way from gci to the turnpike .   it sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping . 
colonel .  .  . we 're all going .   whether you make it or not . 
i know . 
our doctor 's gone too . 
sorry to trouble you . 
wait let me look at that .  .  .  you better come in here . 
boxin' . 
win ? 
yes 'm . 
dorie miller mam . 
i 'm evelyn .   and i 'm just a nurse .   but i 'm not playing golf and that cut needs sewing or else it 's gonna make a big lumpy scar .   whatta ya say ? 
every other sunday .   i 'm heavyweight champion of the west virginia . 
what do you get for winning ? 
respect . 
tell me something dorie .   a man as big as you  and smart too you knew where to come when your ship could n't help  do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect ? 
i left my mama and joined the navy to be a man .   they made me a cook  and not even that really  i clean up after the other sailors eat .   i shine the officer 's shoes .   in two years they 've never even let me fire a gun . 
you too mam . 
you too lieutenant . 
nice to meet you betty . 
no he .  .  . got some news today .   he 'll be okay he just did n't feel like coming tonight . 
i was hoping to meet him . 
fat chance .  you know lee wilkins came to hear me last night .  he told me to forget it .  you told me to forget it .  my parents tell me to forget it . 
just take a look at it .  
if you took the trouble to write it then sure i 'll take a look at it .  but i 'm beginning to think that maybe there 's more to life than music .  i wonder if people would still like me if i stopped being mr .  excitement ? 
it means i care about you and what happens to you . 
that 's all i wanted to hear .  cause i 'm never going to give up on us .  it 's easy to fall apart in a crisis .  it 's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck .  but this is more than love .  this is a mental decision .  just wait till tomorrow when you see your birthday present .  then you 'll understand . 
okay .  listen i cancelled the tickets for fabian .  i thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant chez tres . 
i was trying to save you .  they were going to vaporize you . 
do n't be ridiculous !  they 're just a bunch of harmless old men .  my grandfather was in there . 
you 're going to listen to me . 
right here .  now sit down . 
how could you possibly know what i 've been going through ? 
what ? 
you betrayed me charlie .  you were never there for me or the children .  and now you come and tell me peggy you 're scared .  of course i 'm scared .  if you knew what i knew you 'd be scared shitless . 
you 're crazy !  you 're really out of your mind ! 
i might be crazy but i 'm not crazy enough to marry you twice .  there 's a lot of things i ca n't change .  i ca n't even think about them .  i tried .  but i could n't even help rosalie .   i do n't want to be bitter .  i 'm a naturally optimistic person .  but you took advantage of that . 
of course . 
it opens too .  look inside . 
i know . 
i 'm writing a book on kite construction .  what did you want to talk about ? 
i want to ask you a question .   do you think .  .  . time travel is possible ? 
are you doing some kind of science project ? 
sort of . 
well .  .  .  in a newtonian framework the possibilities were limited but with the advent of relativity theory the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed . 
what 's that ? 
that 's my own theory based on a mexican food called the burrito .  i had it once when my parents took me to disneyland . 
iknow what a burrito is . 
well i think time is like a burrito .  sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other . 
what 's inside ? 
you can till it with whatever you want .  from illusions to memory from experience to innocence from happiness to the entire universes
so you think time travel is possible ?  for people ? 
absolutely .  people dogs elephants . 
listen you 've gotta keep this a secret .  you ca n't tell a soul .  promise ? 
okay .  i promise . 
this is serious .  nobody can know .  ah i 've returned from the future .  i traveled back here 25 years . 
you probably are crazy .  wait a minute .  is this some kind of joke ?  i know what you all think of me . 
how did you know about my grandfather ? 
because i 'm telling you the truth .  i know what 's going to happen .  there 's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants .  and an american named neil armstrong is going to walk on the moon .  on july 20 1969 . 
holy toledo !  that 's six years ahead of schedule ! 
i do n't know . 
that 's why i was getting a divorce .  .   what i really think is that i had a heart attack at the reunion and died . 
you look pretty good for a corpse . 
come on richard i 'm serious . 
you 're giving me the creeps . 
am i dead or not ? 
there 's one way to find out . 
confucious says the way out is through the door .  there 's a truck .  there 's your door . 
what if it 's beyond science ?  what it it 's god ? 
i told you i 've already lived my life .  i do n't know how or why i 'm here but you have to help me get back .  i want to get back to my real life ! 
all right i 'll work on it i 'll do some research .  but in the meantime do n't get crazy . 
i 'm trying .  i 'll see you tomorrow .  
what if you 're not here tomorrow ? 
i 'm just not the type .  besides i want to get out of here . 
but you have a vision .  do n't you want to help your parents ? 
i tried to tell them but they would n't listen to me . 
i 'm talking about invention no investment .  i know what people think of me .  mr .  spasmatician .  dick the square root .  i 'll show them .  you said i was going to be a millionaire .  and you 're gonna help ! 
richard take it easy . 
no offense but for a person who says she 's lived an extra lifetime you certainly are thick .  money is power .  .  money makes people respect you .  .  . 
how come you never ask me any important questions ?  do n't you wonder if there 's going to be a nuclear war ?  or a cure for cancer ?  what about your family ?  what about people ? 
i 'm curious but i do n't want to know .  jeez i hope you have n't been telling people what 's going to happen to them . 
give me some credit will you ? 
good .  you 're discreet .  i like that in a partner . 
wbat 're you talking about ? 
look it 's very simple .  you tell me everything that has n't been invented yet and i 'll invent it .  we 'll be partners .  fiftyfifty . 
sixtyforty . 
when do we start ? 
i am relaxed . 
you 're not going to like this .  please try to smile .  .  . 
you 're going to the office ?  ! 
you 're not smiling . 
one hour ! 
drew ! 
i promise ! 
i said everyone 's going to die jimmy .  but drew 's not going to die of aids .  there 's a cure around the corner and he plans to be around to take advantage of it . 
yes .  i think it will be a simple solution .  they 'll put it in a syringe inject it into your bloodstream .  it 'll neutralize the virus .  it 'll revitalize the immune system and people with aids will become healthy again . 
i have too much work to do .  skip the treatment . 
we 're not skipping this treatment . 
i said skip it michael .  it 's my treatment . 
fuck you . 
fuck you .  this shit 's probably not doing me any good anyway . 
that shit 's saving your life you asshole ! 
close the law book . 
i 'm not going to close the
close the fucking law book ! 
the least you can do is look at me while i 'm sticking this shit into your arm .  forget the fucking case one hour a day and give me a little of your time . 
you do n't think there 's much time left do you ? 
that 's not what i said . 
you 're scared .  you think we 're near the end . 
no . 
maybe i should start making plans is that what you think ?  start planning my memorial service ?  begin to prepare for the inevitable . 
maybe you should think about it . 
what 's that mean ?  ! 
maybe you should think about it . 
i 'm not going to die . 
that 's right .  we 're on the positive plan .  you do n't have a fatal disease you have manageable illness . 
you want me to give up ?  let this thing turn us into uvictimsu ? 
then what uareu we drew ?  !  the uwinnersu ?  ladies and gentlemen the first prize of aids goes to andrew beckett and his lover miguel .  .  .  excuse me i 'm not your lover .  i 'm your care partner .  fuck ! 
i 'm not ready to die . 
do you think i 'm ready for it ?  !  i hate this shit .  i 'm not a fucking martyr !  i hate every goddamn part of it ! 
ready for what baby ? 
whatever . 
i hope you 're ready for studs because that 's what 's on . 
yes character .  to the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job . 
what kind of people ? 
people who want to bend the rules .  .  . 
second . 
great . 
would you like to have a drink with me ?  i just finished a game i could use a beer .   i do n't pick up people in drug stores every day .

i mean two guys doing the horizontal thing ?  i do n't get it .  do n't they get confused ?  is that mine ?  i thought it was yours .  hey call me old fashioned call me conservative .  .  .  i think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is . 
fine joe . 
and the way they work out pumping up so they can be macho and faggot at the same time .  .  .  i ca n't ustandu that shit .  now i 'm being totally honest with you . 
that 's perfectly clear . 
would you take a client if you were constantly thinking i hope this guy does n't touch me .  i do n't even want him to ubreatheu on me ? 
is there some kind of expression i 've picked up from beckett ?  !  some kind of fairy attitude i 've unconsciously adopted ?  !  am i walking different ?  !  some kind of vocal thing ?  !  have i picked up some kind of homo uvibeu ?  ! 
have you changed your aftershave ? 
very funny .  i had a box of pampers under my arm for chrissake ! 
yeah .  .  .   ?

i know  .  .  .  nevertheless i thank you for saving us .  you 'll be in trouble for going there . 
it empties into a sea some miles from here .  that 's where the cave is . 
no one really knows .  it 's an ancient taboo .  set forth in the sacred scrolls .  the lawgiver pronounced the area deadly . 
right now if you like . 
taylor you 're not in command here .  put down that gun .

jackson looks like you got elias' squad now . 
squad ?  i did n't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir .  
these two holes are yours .  .  . 
begging your pardon lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody 'd see them  i got five live bodies left .  .  . 
i do n't want to hear your problems jackson .  you 'll get new men any day .  time being you make do like everybody else . 
hey lieutenant i did n't ask for this job i .  .  . 
i do n't want to hear about it jackson . 
you do n't want to hear about it ? 
that 's right .  i do n't want to hear about it cause to tell you the truth i do n't give a shit okay .  .  .  i just do n't give a shit anymore . 
right .  .  . 
this is one time we could sure use elias . 
my name 's larry mitchell .  i live in vancouver . 
i 'm afraid there 's nothing i can do about it mr .  mitchell . 
how far does this train go ? 
vancouver b . c . 
i 'm going to vancouver mr .  mitchell . 
perhaps i do n't take it so lightly . 
where are you staying in vancouver royal .  it 's pretty crowded you know . 
is it ?  i expected to go to the vancouver royal .  should i have a reservation ? 
i 'll make one for you .   i live there . 
well .  . 
a very small service .  it does n't even ask for thanks .  how long for ? 
i really do n't know . 
indefinitely ? 
i do n't know . 
you do n't know . 
very nice mitchell turns . 
no thanks ? 
thank you . 
suppose i had n't known that immigration inspector ?  had n't put in a good word for you ? 
i 'm supposing . 
i think you 're a nice girl .  i like you .  but i can read signs if the print is large enough .  it was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector .   a sort of tenseness as if you were afraid of something . 
yes ? 
how about taking to uncle larry into the old firm ?  he 's a useful guy to have on your side . 

do n't get me wrong betty .  i 'm not suggesting you murdered anybody you know . 
not tonight . 
what 's the matter ? 
i 'm not in the mood for dining and dancing . 
we have some nice places around vancouver . 
i 'm sure you have . 
well how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o 'clock ?   a friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there . 
i have n't been invited . 
nobody gets invited to clark brandon's parties .  they just go . 
perhaps i 'd better get you straightened out mr .  mitchell .  you 've been rather nice to me in a couple of ways .  and i 'm grateful .  but i do n't think this entitles you to put me on a leash . 
nobody i 'd rather have on a leash . 
i 'm trying very hard to be polite about it . 
would you mind ? 
okay .  you win . 
if you change your mind about the cocktail party or anything else give me a buzz . 
if i change my mind . 
you 're not english . 
how 's life treating you ? 
the usual grind . 
round of golf saturday ? 
if i can get off . 
hardly .  who 's the girl ? 
somebody mitchell picked up on the train .  i do n't even know her name . 
she does n't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train . 
that 's what i thought at first .   maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party .   with my liquor of course . 
yes i 've seen it before . 
on miss mayfield 's balcony .  .  beside the chaise i picked it up .  do n't ask me why .  i ought to know better . 
quite sure you had no motive ? 
i rather thought so .  and before that had you ever seen the gun ? 
no . 
near his right hand .  about a foot away .  perhaps more .  good heavens one does n't use a tape measure . 
we do when we get the chance . 
no thanks .  i had some .  how would you like to take a walk for say half and hour ? 
delightfully .  every time miss mayfield says something i know less than i did before .   well i may as well knock off for tonight .   good night miss mayfield .  do let me thank you for your cooperation . 
i do n't . 
wellgood night . 
sit on that log dear . 
penfield .   james penfield .

that does n't matter .   as long as we can get our message through to someone there .   jill where are those handouts ? 
very good . 
but what we need is national coverage .   it 's difficult with this falklands madness going on .  do you think you might be able to do something when you get back ? 
i 'll suggest it .   remember though we 're news not features .   it might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police .   anyway i 'll be back with this soon .  thanks . 
not too bad thanks .   how have you been ? 
working hard on that book i was telling you about .   coming to the meeting ? 
i 'm not sure i can face it .

she 's fine .   well actually we 've broken up .   it 's all over . 
no .   that 's terrible charles .  what happened ? 
look i 'd rather you did n't ask me questions .   i ca n't talk about it . 
exactly that . 
do n't tell me you 've actually read it jeremy . 
i see . 
jesus christ bodhi ! 
i 'm not fbi anymore .

what 's that general ? 
someone else will be going in with you . 
there 's something else major .  .  .

same business guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper .  .  .  followed by men with american equipment .  .  . 
hawkins ? 
i ca n't tell . 
i think it 's hawkins . 
where the hell is his body ? 
there 's no sign of it . 
he knows our defenses . 
why did n't he try to kill one of us last night ? 
no wonder .   for starts you should know that hot pants are uhorridu even when you do have the legs to carry them off .   what are your plans while you 're in town ? 
well .  .  .  i might be going out to dinner . 
you 'll want a cocktail dress then .   turn .   you have a beautiful figure .   a little too out in the open but simply lovely .   size six ?  do you need shoes ? 
i dunno .   do thigh high leather boots go with a cocktail dress ?

it 's not your fault .   you 're right .   kit 's right .   but i want the fairy tale . 
of course yes .   if you 'll excuse me just a moment 
i have a message for you from your niece sir . 
my what ? 
the young lady staying in your room ? 
thank you . 
afternoon . 
give me your car keys will you i 'm going back to my hotel . 
at least stay for a drink .   this party 's for you . 
apologize to elizabeth for me . 
really ?   some high class gold digger who speaks french better than i do ?   no thank you .   i just got off the phone with one . 
cynthia 's not coming ? 
no . 
yes !   and you do n't even know where you 're going ! 
did you say i do ? 
well no we sort of skipped that part . 
then you 're not married  if you did n't say it you did n't do it   would n't you agree your highness ? 
i believe you  so what happens now ? 
we face each other as god intended .  sportsmanlike .  no tricks no weapons skill against skill alone . 
you mean you 'll put down your rock and i 'll put down my sword and we 'll try to kill each other like civilized people ? 
i could kill you now . 
it 's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest .  i do n't even exercise .                                                             38 . 
i just want you to feel you 're doing well .  i hate for people to die embarrassed . 
and a good thing too . 
why do you wear a mask ?  were you burned by acid or something like that ?                                                             39 . 
well i have n't fought just one person for so long .  i 've been specializing in groups .  battling gangs for local charities that kind of thing . 
well  .  .  .    .  .  .  you see you use different moves when you 're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one . 
who 's guilder ? 
the country across the sea .  the sworn enemy of florin .   go ! 
you never said anything about killing anyone . 
i just do n't think it 's right killing an innocent girl . 
am i going mad or did the word think escape your lips ?  you were not hired for your brains you hippopotamic land mass . 
i ought to be after twenty years . 
tell me . 
i am not lefthanded either . 
no one of consequence . 
i must know . 
get used to disappointment . 
okay . 
i would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself .  however since i ca n't have you following me either 
that would be inconceivable . 
you 're sure nobody 's following us ? 
as i told you it would be absolutely totally and in all other ways inconceivable .  no one in guilder knows what we 've done .  and no one in florin could have gotten here so fast .  out of curiosity why do you ask ? 
no reason .  it 's only i just happened to look behind us and something is there . 
what ? 
i do n't swim .                                                             15 . 
whoever he is he 's too late    see ?   the cliffs of insanity .                                                             19 . 
inconceivable ! 
you keep using that word  i do not think it means what you think it means .   my god !  he 's climbing . 
good .   let 's fool around .   now i 'll be the innocent little milk maid and you 'll be the naughty stable boy .   oh this milk is so heavy .   i 'll never reach the house .   help .   will someone help me ? 
wait .   wait .   we ca n't play today .  i have too many appointments .

and we 'll finish playing the contessa and rudolfo . 
and after that we 'll play the abduction and cruel rape of lucretia  .  .  .  and i 'll play lucretia .

let 's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking . 
yes .  he traced her to that motel out on the old highway .  .  . 
bates' motel .   he has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it .  .  .  go on sam . 
he traced her there and called us to say he was going to question mrs .  bates .  .  . 
norman took a wife ? 
no .  an old woman his mother .   that was early this evening .  and we have n't seen or heard from him since .  i went out to the motel just got back .  no one was in the office and .  .  . 
maybe you saw mary ! 
i 'd know the difference between mary and an old woman . 
he 's already been . 
at this hour ? 
you must remember that bad business out there .  about ten years ago .  .  . 
arbogast . 
arbogast .   and after he left ?   no it 's okay norman .  how 's it been going out there ?   well i think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action a smaller place you know .  .  .  but .  .  . 
so you can give me an argument and tell me i 'm wrong .  do n't be sil kid . 
well no one would ever suspect it .  you do n't sound right . 
all right wise guy .  go ahead .  spill it . 
jim there 's a little hokeypokey wax museum opening up down on 14th street . 
now do n't that call for an extra ! 
i asked you to keep your trap shut ! 
well you ca n't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that . 
all right you poor baboon you can guess the rest of it ! 
no kiddin' .  what 's your idea ? 
just this  i got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they have n't got a wax figure of joan gale in that lineup then i 'm crazy . 
we 'll grant that . 
what ! 
about the gale girl i mean .  where do we go from there ?  what of it ? 
listen jojo .  does this mean anything to you ?  joan gale 's body swiped from the morgue  did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask ? 
i used to be married to one . 
and it came to life and divorced you .  i know all about that .  now my idea is this somebody swipes the girl 's body takes impression makes a mold produces wax figure  .  .  .  bingo !   .  .  .  peddles it to this old skate down there ! 
work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it . 
let it go . 
come down to earth .  do you think they would dare do anything like that ?  do n't you think they 'd know that figure would be recognized ?  shake your head real hard  you 'll be all right . 
all right master mind .   but there 's something cockeyed about that joint and i 'm going to find out what it is .  
oh by the way another pet theory of yours just blew up . 
what do you mean ? 
that dear innocent judge ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in south america . 
no kiddin' ? 
almost certain . 
almost !  i 'll still bet i 'm right and let you write your own ticket . 
you here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness ? 
this one 's a story but i 'm not going to tell you what it is .  every time i tell you anything it goes haywire . 
what do you mean  haywire ?  you start out after murderers and come back with threeforadime bootleggers .  you start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games .  you 're grand !  i 'm for you !  stupendous ! 
say you 're always razzing everything i do but this is one time i 'm in . 
go on little girl take your troubles somewhere else .  i do n't feel like talking to you . 
was there any art on judge ramsey ? 
what goofy idea have you got now ?  do n't tell me you suspect judge ramsey of stealing the body . 
i 'm going to make you eat dirt you soap bubble !  i 'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go ! 
yes you could .  cut out this rotten business and act like a lady .  marry me . 
i 'm going to get even with you you dirty stiff !  i 'll do it ! 
where were you going when you got in that cab ? 
i do n't remember .  not so very far

you used to go to worth 's place a whole lot .  what makes you sure it was n't there ? 
well maybe it was .  i do n't remember .   you got to do something for me i ca n't stand it any longer  i ca n't !

i 'm people which the old year saw out .  i 'm canned fired ! 
no kiddin' . 
i 've got to make news if i have to bite a dog .   hey kelly !  oh mi gosh even he walked out on me . 
i 've got a story for you .  you know the joan gale girl ? 
yes she committed suicide yesterday .  that 's not news .  i heard about it last year . 
oh yeah ?  maybe she did n't commit suicide .  she may have been murdered ! 
no foolin'  any suspect ? 
do you know george winton ? 
old howard winton's cub ? 
that 's the one . 
they do n't suspect ihimi ? 
do n't they ?  he 's down at the tombs right now . 
say if you 're stringin' me oldtimer  .  .  . 
why would i string y' ?  they were sweeties until a month ago . 
what does that prove ? 
nothing .  only she may have tried to blackmail him .  you know such things have happened .  anyway he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead . 
hotcha !  saved one job ! 
there 's an autopsy ordered at bellevue immediately .  you better skip over there .

welcome to beverly hills .  wifeswapping capital of the world . 
beats me .   you got a suggestion feel free to shout it out genius . 
what ? 
the booze . 
i do n't know .   i could quit now if i wanted i just do n't want to . 
name one . 
dean martin . 
entertainers do n't count . 
okay seriously .   what about napoleon huh ? 
what about him ? 
you 've never heard of napoleon brandy mister smartypants ?   how do you think it got its name ? 
i also thought he could be turned back to the good side .  it could n't be done .  he is more machine now than man .  twisted and evil . 
i ca n't do it ben . 
you cannot escape your destiny . 
i tried to stop him once .  i could n't do it . 
vader humbled you when first you met him luke .  .  .  but that experience was part of your training .  it taught you among other things the value of patience .  had you not been so impatient to defeat vader then you could have finished your training here with yoda .  you would have been prepared . 
but i had to help my friends . 
i ca n't kill my own father . 
then the emperor has already won .  you were our only hope . 
yoda spoke of another . 
the other he spoke of is your twin sister . 
but i have no sister . 
hmm .  to protect you both from the emperor you were hidden from your father when you were born .  the emperor knew as i did if anakin were to have any offspring they would be a threat to him .  that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous . 
leia !  leia 's my sister . 
your insight serves you well .  bury your feelings deep down luke .  they do you credit .  but they could be made to serve the emperor . 
she has n't been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have luke .  .  .  but the force is strong with her as it is with all of your family .  there is no avoiding the battle .  you must face and destroy vader ! 
i ca n't see . 
your eyesight will return in time . 
where am i ? 
jabba 's palace . 
who are you ? 
you have done well lord vader .  and now i sense you wish to continue your search for young skywalker . 
yes my master . 
patience my friend .  in time he will seek you out .  and when he does you must bring him before me .  he has grown strong .  only together can we turn him to the dark side of the force . 
as you wish . 
everything is proceeding as i have foreseen . 
send the fleet to the far side of endor .  there it will stay until called for . 
what of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near sullust ? 
it is of no concern .  soon the rebellion will be crushed and young skywalker will be one of us !  your work here is finished my friend .  go out to the command ship and await my orders . 
yes my master . 
a small rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on endor . 
strange that i have not .  i wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear lord vader . 
then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for them . 
his lightsaber . 
oh dear !   but then where did the motorcyclists come from ? 
hmmm  .  .  .  well i guess we will have to turn back . 
we must have a blowout . 
oh .  .  . 
but where will you go ?   we 're in the middle of nowhere . 
did n't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles ?   maybe they have a telephone i might use . 
there 's no point both of us getting wet . 
i 'm coming with you .   besides darling the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back . 
just a moment janet .   they may have a telephone . 
yes . 
oh it 's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos . 
say !   do any of you guys know the madison ? 
for god 's sake keep a grip on yourself janet . 
but it seems so unhealthy here . 
it 's just a .  . a party janet . 
well i want to leave . 
we ca n't go anywhere until i get to a phone . 
then ask the butler  or someone . 
let 's wait awhile janet .   we do n't want to interfere with their celebrations . 
this is n't the junior chamber of commerce brad . 
they 're probably foreigners with ways different from our own .     they may do some more folk dancing . 
brad  i 'm cold i 'm wet and plain scared . 
i 'm here there 's nothing to worry about . 
we 'll just say where we are then go back to the car we do n't want to be any worry . 
 .  .  . no wine  bad for ya' brain . 
c 'mon man it 's cold man . 
no wine . 
yo rock gimme a dollar .

it ai n't your fault  i originally done it in the baby crenshaw fight .   that 's me fightin' big baby crenshaw  big baby was the size of an airplane an' i broke my hands on his head  i lost but it 's a nice picture do n't ya think ?

yeah  my ol' man who was never the sharpest told me  i were n't born with much brain so i better use my body . 
i must be goin' deaf cause i thought ya said ten cents . '
charge it . 
well i 'll be .  .  . 
so what 's your next move valiant ? 
i know who you are .   kinda out of your neighborhood are n't you ? 
yeah i had to go slummin' .   see a friend of mine 's bein' framed .

you do n't believe that .   i mean .  the guy 's an idiot a moron a complete fool .  .  .   but he 'd never kill anyone .  i know the guy . 
c 'mon valiant does n't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you ?   i mean no offense but how did a muckymuck like r . k .  maroon find you in the first place ? 
so where is it then ? 
somebody took it from him .   that 's what this whole thing 's about .

i 've already dropped it on you twentythree times . 
do n't worry about me .   i can take it . 
i 'm not worried about you .   i 'm worried about the safe .

r . k .  maroon . 
yeah ? 
 .  .  .  i 'd head for cucamonga . 
i followed you to the maroon studios .  when i heard those shots i thought i 'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk . 
not before i satisfy my sense of moral outrage . 
that 's because it 's disappearingreappearing ink .   shows up three days later .   gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he does n't punch you in the nose .   great gag . 
yeah .  .  .

good because it cost enough .   there 's cheaper phones by far than that one man you better fucking use it . 
i intend to .   this phone is wired like no other it 's got an encryption chip and instant satalink recognition it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand .   with my custom hardware and this phone i can trace the target 's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes .  .  . 
you sure about this ? 
i 'd stake my reputation . 
but would you stake your life that 's the question .  .  . 
in this business your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same . 
i use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target .   i trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through nice relaying that information to you . 
next . 
ready when you are .  .  . 
there 's a problem .  .  . 
should any of you decide to rush me i 'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time . 
do n't do it sam ! 
shut up ! 
he 'll kill me anway sam shoot though me and kill this fucker . 
i 'm touched really that they 'd send someone of your caliber .   it 's nice to know that they did n't make the mistake of underestimating me twice . 
that was a mistake trying to kill you .  mikhi did it without consulting me i 'd have never allowed it . 
i 'm sure .   but i 'm sorry to say that it 's too late for trust we have a serious problem . 
we 'll double your price .

i think not .   after you .  .  . 
seamus reilly . 
why did n't you kill him ? 
how is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us ?

matter of face there 's this flick i 've been hearing about .   i have n't seen it but from what i hear it 's pretty cool . 
i might know where you could get a copy .

that son of a bitch . 
booth .   do n't .   it 's nothing .  it 's not worth it .   remember what happened the last time ?

let 's hope so .  sally if he asks me again i 'm gonna tell him i returned it all . 
dammit i 'm so sick of this . 
i know . 
every night i think about you sleeping with him him slobbering all over you . 
he does n't slobber he just snores .  and i told you we have n't .  .  . done anything in over a year . 
it does n't matter .  .  . he 's next to you .   you know i always say to myself you should have left him years ago .  why did n't you ? 
i used to think he was something once .  .  .   i was eighteen i did n't know any better and he had something steady to offer . 
i hate it when you talk like this .   go on . 
we 'd .  .  .  i do n't know .  .  . go to california new york maybe a house on a swiss mountainside .  .  . 
it 'd have to be switzerland to make sure dwayne never finds us .

without oxygen .  .  . 
we think so . 
nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two sherpas and a yak . 
a prewedding luau ? 
but the most interesting thing here is that i do n't see the rose tattoo that i 've heard about on your back . 
he is not ! 
you can turn that finger around . 
obviously i 'm not the only one who does n't understand it .   the uss maggie leaves quite a wake .  .  .  excuse me .

i 'm not a boastful man .   what 's your point ? 
there 's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true 
what was what ? 
what 's with you ? 
nothing 's with me . 
that 's what she called him on the show .   because he ca n't sleep . 
and now 2000 women want his number .   the guy could be a crackhead a psychopath a flasher a junkie a transvestite a chainsaw murderer or someone really sick like rick . 
actually he sounded nice . 
oh ?  oh really ?  now we 're getting down to it .

 .  .  .  movie .   that 's your problem .   you do n't want to be in love .   you want to be in love in a movie .   read it to me . 
dear sleepless and son .  .  . 
it sounds like the name of a mattress store 
i am not the sort of person who listens to callin radio shows 
i know that .   you think i do n't know that ?  i know that 's a dumb way to begin but it 's the only way i can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when i heard the two of you on the radio .   on the other hand maybe i 'm just losing my mind . 
you are .   you 're losing your mind .   what about walter ? 
i 'm going to marry walter .   i just have to get this out of my system . 
right . 
i should say something in this about magic . 
what ? 
i do n't know .   i mean what if i never meet him ?  what if this man is my destiny and i never meet him ? 
your destiny can be your doom .  look at me and rick . 
i want to meet you .  .  . 
good .   perfect .   i 'll be in new york with walter i can squeeze it in . 
you never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet . 
he lost all the weight .  .  .  there . 
that 's impossible .   a guy ca n't 
can too . 
no . 
yes . 
and then you left him ?  he lost weight there and you left him ? 
plus he fell in love with a temp . 
listen to this i love this part 
i know . 
do you think at the end of the movie when she 's in the wheelchair they can still do it ? 
i always wondered about that too . 
turn on your radio ! 
what ? 
the kid is on .   you 've got me listening to this garbage .  go on turn it on . 
you 'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it . 
definitely . 
who is annie ? 
the one who wrote us . 
i sincerely hope you are not going to marry jessica . 
it might be in the kitchen . 
are you going with her ? 
yes . 
this is the one i like .

shut up . 
this conversation is finished .

no . 
i mean so far have i screwed it up for you ?

sure . 
that 's it ? 
are you australian ? 
no . 
good .  i fucking hate australians . 
yeah ?  first door on the right .  it ai n't that dirty .   just kinda' filthy is all . 
you mind ? 
i was talking to my wife . 
shhh . 
the spiders . 
yeah . 
what can i do for you ? 
um coupla' eight balls oughta do us . 
come on .   ease off the girl . 
bobby bobby bobby .   rhymes with  .  .  .  
not even a guess ? 

how about in the house ? 
they were wearing ski masks .  i told you all of this . 
did you see his hair color ? 
no why ? 
big bill
what ?  ! 
please  .  .  i do n't know what you 're  .  .  . 
uhuhuh  .  .  .

yeah . 
do n't do that .  please .   or i 'll kill you .   please danny . 
what the hell was that ?  who told you i was five0 ? 
no one .  it was just a test .  i need to be sure of who i 'm dealing with from timetotime . 
i 'll keep that in mind . 
just some buddies . 
this is bullshit .   you did n't say anything about anybody else being here . 
what the fuck are you gonna do about it dickhead ? 
yeah dickhead . 
you did n't volunteer jackson . 
i most likely would have sir had i been given the opportunity . 
i 'd love to hear it . 
seems to me cap 'n this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources .   miller go on . 
yes sir .   it seems to me sir that the entire resources of the united states army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop smackdab in the middle of berlin germany .   now i ai n't one to question decisions made up on high sir but it seems to me that saving one private no matter how grievous the losses of his family is a waste of my godgiven talent . 
wade ? 
in the shadow by those two trees . 
my guess too . 
they do n't send planes to put out machine guns .   two flank runners with surpressing fire .   i 'm going right whoever goes left has to be fast . 
gives wade the second shot . 
sir i ai n't feeling so chipper on account of wade . 
who 's wade ? 
you 'll grieve the way i tell you to goddamned grieve .   there is no wade there was one but he died a long time ago he 's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name you understand ? 
sir i understand .   i do n't like it but i understand . 
good now get your goddamned gear . 
keep trying . 
say what cap 'n ? 
you see i 've got the best house in all of addley .   it 's not the biggest house but it 's got the best location right next to the junior high baseball field .   the garage windows face left field .   the guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen s put over them .   the first thing i did when i bought the place was take off those screens .   twohundredtwenty two yards from home plate to my garage windows .   it takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far .   i look at my garage windows as a motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship .   i lay there in my hammock and every time i hear the sound of breaking glass i know we 're one step closer to winning it all . 
do n't that get kind of expensive cap 'n ? 
it 's worth it . 
to each his own . 
yes sir . 
struggling with a pair of germans . 
looks at miller sees him growing weak starting to sway .   he gently tries to move miller aside . 
races through the debris .   trailed by bullets . 
upham and jackson what were they like ? 
upham ?   good kid smart he was writing a book . 
yeah ? 
and sarge ? 
sarge ?   he was the best friend i ever had .   lemme tell you about sarge .  .  . 
that 's because as i have pointed out on numerous occasions you are a happy idiot . 
no i just happen to take the captain's advice and look at the bright side of things . 
as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted my grandfather got old as grandfathers tend to do .  he needed someone to take care of him .   we move around all the time going from one mine to another so we had to put him in a home .   nice enough place but kind of depressing .  but not for granddad .   he just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship going to tahiti he had his own cabin first class with room service .   it just so happened that the weather was always lousy so he never bothered to go up on deck .  happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died . 
reiben you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes . 
you want unpleasant ?   just wait i can do much better than this . 
look at upham you do n't hear him complaining . 
we all have he 's got nine lives or he 's bulletproof or some damn thing . 
would you hold this for me ? 
yeah
they 're bavarian death style  pretzels . 
oh .   um would it be terrible if i wanted to go home early ? 
no . 
yeah i have to judge who can drive home and who ca n't .  i have to keep their keys . 
so it 's an honor ? 
no . 
yeah . 
it 's the worst job since keymaster . 
i hereby surrender my duties as keymaster give me a beer . 
bye . 
mine say stuff like lloyd see you around maybe
nobody knew me before tonight . 
they knew of you .   now they know you . 
yeah but i feel like i fit in for the first time you know ?  like i just held them far away from me and they did the same to me . 
that 's cool then . 
yeah .   i 'm so glad we did this . 
yeah but that 's an old story you do n't want to hear it . 
sure i do . 
well my parents split up when i was thirteen and .  .  .  god i actually had to .  .  .  i went into court and i had to choose between the two of them .   so i chose my dad .   it just felt safer that way you know ? 
watch out for that glass . 
twisted ?

so we found a compromise . 
or it found us . 
we have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings .

page 32 .  deputy dewey filled the room with his dimwitted barney fifish presence .  i think you 've explained yourself . 
oh dewey i 'm sorry . 
no what you are is a money hungry fame seeking liar andforgive me for saying mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be . 
does the name maureen prescott sound familiar to you ? 
nope .

horror flicks .  bmovies from milton's heyday . 
i 'm sorry miss weathers .  allow me to introduce myself mark kincaid l . a . p . d .   are you familiar with the actor ben damon or the actress christine perkins ? 
well i interviewed damon once for the show .  he was a real obnoxious fuck .  any way the second one christine perkins she had a part in stab 2 did n't she ?  she was playing cici . 
both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the hollywood sign .  autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the stab films . 
so is that why you 're here ?  is that why you 're holding me from my show to tell me about some brutal homicide i 'm not even involved in ? 
i wish that was all miss weathers but there 's more .  the killer left a note . 
a note ? 
there 's more . 
i 'd love to help really i would n't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath but i honestly do n't know where sidney is .  after windsor she dropped off the face of the earth .  the only other person that might know is  not going to talk . 
and who would that be ? 
i go to the police station and do my job and you go back to being gale weathers . 
oh .  i thought you wanted me to stick around . 
look miss weathers if there 's a problem give me a call .  here 's my card .  i 'm always there .

yes well we have a suspect so do n't get that worried . 
i 'm not at liberty to tell you that miss weathers .  you 're no longer working with the l . a . p . d .  i do n't even know why you 're standing in here right now .  by all means i should have you thrown out . 
but you wo n't .  you 're a good man detective .  we think alike .  i know you need my help .  and i know you know i need your help .

i was hoping sid and i could talk . 
oh yeah . 
it 's an easy game .  we ask you a question .  if you get it wrong  you die . 
and if you get it right  you die . 
yeah we just watched a few movies .  took a few notes .  it was fun . 
and did they really ever explain why hannibal lecter liked to eat people ?  do n't think so .  you see it 's scarier when there 's no motive sid . 
that 's right and now that you 're no longer a virgin .  you gotta die  those are the rules .

we 'll find him sid .  do n't worry . 
not yet but we 're looking .  if you need anything .  .  . 
somebody called me dewey .  i 'm not making it up . 
i know .  we 're checking every cellular account in the county .  any calls made to you or casey becker are being crossreferenced .  it 's gonna take time but we 'll find him . 
and my dad ?  any word on him ?

should i be worried ? 
not yet . 
how is everything ? 
hank loomis' kid ?  aw .  .  .  jesus .  .  . 
he 's her boyfriend . 
what were you doing out here ? 
drive by patrol . 
how is she ? 
she 's tough . 
have to be .  the shit she 's gone through . 
i do n't know they just did . 
that is so sexist .  the killer could easily be female  basic instinct . 
i did .  he 's full of shit . 
hey go easy tatum .  he did n't do it . 
for once stu drop it . 
okay but whatever you did  the entire student body thanks you . 
where you guys been ?  we had to start without you . 
tits  see .

hey guess who 's here ?  it 's that chick from inside story ? 
give it to me . 
how 's that ? 
there 's nothing that says i have to work with him .   if somerset wants out goodbye .   give it to me . 
thank you . 
go start picking up the pieces .   we 'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner . 
they pay cops for the inside scoop and they pay well . 
sorry about that .  .  .  i just .  .  . 
oh it 's alright . 
a landlord 's dream tenant a paralyzed man with no tongue . 
who pays the rent on time . 
this is the job .   it 's not an easter egg hunt . 
there must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow .   i mean christ .  .  .  do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves . 
it 's too dismissive to call him a lunatic .  we ca n't make that mistake . 
oh blah blah blah .   the guy 's insane . 
it 's a fine line between insane and inspired . 
hey freud what brand of bullshit are you shoveling huh ?   right now he 's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy 's panties singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter .  .  . 
no . 
sooner or later his luck 's goning to run out . 
no .   he 's not depending on luck .   you 've seen that .   we walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied victor to the bed to the day .   to the day !  because he wanted us to . 
we do n't know for sure .  .  . 
yes we do .   here .  .  . 
and so what ? 
well he 's been right so far has n't he ? 
just because the bastard has a library card it does n't make him einstein . 
just realize .  .  .  this is not some common lunatic .   the type of intestinal fortitude it must take .  .  .  to keep a man bound for a full year .   to connect tubes to his genitals .   to sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints .   he 's methodical and exacting and worst of all he 's patient . 
what does all that matter anyway ?   it 's not our job to figure him out is it ?   all we have to do is catching him . 
i do n't know .  .  .  like fifty . 
let 's go . 
it 's be best if you got to the point cause i 'm about ready to punch you in the face . 
him ? 
for a long time the f . b . i . s been hooked into the library system keeping accurate records . 
what ?   assessing fines ? 
they monitor reading habits .   not every book but certain ones are flagged .   books about .  .  .  let 's say how to build a nuclear bomb or maybe mein kampf .   whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the f . b . i .  from then on . 
you got to be kidding . 
flagged books cover every topic the bureau deems questionable .  .  .  communism to violent crime . 
how is this legal ? 
legal .  .  .  illegal .   these terms do n't apply .  i do n't applaud it . 
if you want to know who 's been reading paradise lost purgatory and say .  .  .  the life and time of charlie manson the bureau 's computer will tell you .   it might give us a name . 
yeah .   some college student who 's taking english 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on twentieth century crime . 
yeah well .  .  .  at least we 're out of the office .   we 've got pizza . 
how do you know all about this ? 
i do n't .   neither do you . 
we 're focusing . 
i know i know .  .  .  focusing on one little thing . 
the divine comedy .   a history of catholicism .   a book called murderers and madmen .

what brings you back ? 
what 's that you say ? 
why are you here now ? 
they turned me loose from the state hospital . 
is that right ?   are you going to be staying here long ? 
i reckon mr .  woolridge got me hired on to work for bill cox 's outfit . 
do you have family here ? 
not really to speak of . 
so you 're really going to stay here ? 
that boy wants me to . 
did you knock on the door yet ? 
naw i ai n't . 
how long have you been standing here ? 
quite a spell i reckon . 
listen before you get very used to staying here i think you and i need to talk about a few things .  can i take you to lunch ? 
i done et just a little bit ago . 
i mean tomorrow or the next day . 
i reckon i can stand to eat a little somethin' or nother at noontime tomorrow .  bill cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters .  but i reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow . 
okay i 'll come by mr .  cox 's and get you at noon . 
jesus tommy it ai n't science you know .  you got your good trades and your bad trades .  that 's how it works . 
they did n't have to do a thing that 's all i 'm saying .  the team was good the best fucking team in baseball .  but then they had to screw it up .   they traded their birthright for a mess of porridge .   a mess of porridge . 
i used to smoke raleigh cigarettes .  they came with a free gift coupon in every pack . 
i do n't know tommy .  you think anyone gives a rat 's ass about kuwait ?  i read something about the head sheik over there .  he marries a different virgin every friday and then divorces her on monday .  you think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that ? 
huh ? 
you still have that watch auggie gave you ? 
ticktock ticktock . 
so what 's the time ? 
twelveeleven .   twelvetwelve .   twelvetwelve . 
i ca n't believe i did that  .  .  .  christ .  i 'm walking around in a fog  .  .  . 
no harm done .  everything 's okay now .   i 've got to be going . 
no wait .  you ca n't just walk off .   you saved my life . 
i just happened to be there .   the right place at the right time . 
i owe you something . 
it 's okay mister .  no big deal . 
yes it is .  it 's a law of the universe .  if i let you walk away the moon will spin out of orbit  .  .  .  pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years . 
well if you put it that way .  .  . 
you have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance . 
that 's all right .  if i think of something i 'll send my butler over to tell you . 
come on .  at least let me buy you a cup of coffee . 
i do n't drink coffee .   on the other hand since you insist if you offered me a cold lemonade .  i would n't say no . 
good .  lemonade it is .   i 'm paul . 
rashid .  rashid cole .  
that 's okay .  i 've already had lunch . 
you must eat lunch pretty early .  it 's only eleven o 'clock . 
i mean breakfast . 
yeah sure and i bet you had lobster last night .  along with two bottles of champagne . 
just one bottle .  i believe in moderation . 
look kid it 's okay with me .  you do n't have to play games .  if you want a hamburger or something go ahead and order it . 
well maybe just one .  to be polite . 
cocktail hour is over .  the young man would like to order a hamburger . 
you do n't have to tell me if you do n't want to but i might be able to help . 
you do n't know me from a hole in the wall . 
that 's true .  but i also owe you something and i 'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job .   what is it ?  family problems ?  money problems ? 
oh no .  momsie and popsie have oodles . 
and where do momsie and popsie live ? 
east seventyfourth street . 
in manhattan ? 
of course .  where else ? 
then what are you doing in park slope ?  it 's a little far from home is n't it ? 
that 's where the what comes in . 
the what ? 
the what .   i 've kind of run away from home you see .   it has nothing to do with my parents or money .  i saw something i was n't supposed to see and for the time being it 's best that i keep myself out of sight . 
you ca n't be more specific than that ? 
uhhuh .  one of those cozy bed and breakfast places probably . 
yeah that 's right . 
except that there 's no bed is there ?  and no breakfast either . 
the material world is an illusion .  it does n't matter if they 're there or not .  the world is in my head . 
but your body is in the world is n't it ?   if someone offered you a place to stay you would n't necessarily refuse would you ? 
people do n't do that kind of thing .  not in new york . 
i 'm not people .  i 'm just me .  and i do whatever i goddamn want to do .  got it ? 
thanks but i 'll manage . 
in case you 're wondering i like women not little boys .  and i 'm not offering you a longterm lease  just a place to crash for a couple of nights . 
i can take care of myself .  do n't worry . 
suit yourself .  but if you change your mind here 's the address .  
same here .  but i had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon .  you know to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture and he said it would be okay . 
this is the first house i 've been in without a tv . 
i used to have one but it broke a couple of years ago and i never got around to replacing it .   i 'd just as soon not have one anyway .  i hate those damn things . 
but then you do n't get to watch the ball games .  you told me you were a mets fan . 
i listen on the radio .  i can see the games just fine that way .   the world is in your head remember ? 
nice drawing .  did you do that ? 
my father did .  believe it or not that little baby is me . 
yeah i can believe it . 
it 's strange though is n't it ?  looking at yourself before you knew who you were . 
is your father an artist ? 
no he was a schoolteacher .  but he liked to dabble . 
he 's dead ? 
twelve thirteen years ago .   actually he died with his sketch pad open on his lap .  up in the berkshires one weekend drawing a picture of mount greylock . 
drawing 's a good thing . 
is that what you do ?  draw pictures ? 
yeah sometimes .   i like to dabble too . 
twelve . 
my expertise .   is that i 'm a journalist . 
but is n't the utruthu that there are useveralu other ways to explain ueachu of these twelve pieces . 
oh yes . 
like you could n't believe . 
he did n't want to lose any more . 
that 's how journalists .   answer questions . 
that 's curious .   i was uappealingu to their intelligence . 
uwereu you sir ?   can you uproveu one word of all your fancy story ? 
no sir i ca n't .   not beyond a reasonable doubt . 
oh yeh .   he said someday he would get his land back . 
oh yeh .   but this is nine year ago i had my healt i was n't wantin' to sell . 
and then your stroke came this summer .   and you put your property on the market i believe you said september 7 .   which remember is ueightu days before carl heine died .  and who comes spetember 7 wanting to buy ? 
carl heine came . 
he said he did n't want that life no more .   he 'd been saving to buy a farm .   he was sorry i got sick .  but pretty excited to get back his father 's place . 
me and tiny we had them cornered  but we lost em in the shuffle . 
where were you guys ? 
i 'll say . 
i mean we get paid tonight do n't we ? 
yeah .   why ? 
dentist ?   we been out of work for four months  and you want to blow your first week 's pay on your teeth ?

you 're going to bet my money on a dog ? 
he 's a shooin .   i got the word from max the waiter  his brotherinlaw is the electrician who wires the rabbit 
what are you giving me with the rabbit ? 
look at those odds  ten to one .  if he wins we can pay everybody . 
but suppose he loses ? 
what are you worried about ?   this job is going to last a long time . 
but suppose it does n't ? 
jerryboy  why do you have to paint everything so black ?  suppose you get hit by a truck ?  suppose the stock market crashes ?

trust me .   even checked em with my own eyes . 
all right i 'll give it a shot . 
ai n't it the truth .  the two say nothing for a beat 
i do n't know .   everything 's up in the air at this point no pun intended . 
why did n't they say ? 
well that hotel begins construction in january there 's going to be a lot of shuttle work . 
you want to go back to shuttle work ? 
it 's steady good benefits . 
that 's very pragmatic of you barnes . 
thank you . 
nah i already ate .   why do n't you just go down there ? 
uh .  .  . 
well maybe i will .   you sure you do n't want anything ? 
no .   i 'm all set .   thanks . 
well maybe i 'll surprise you . 
i can hardly wait . 
yeah yeah yeah give me a minute here . 
that 's very professional sounding of you taylor . 
why yes ryan i am and thanks for asking .   you do n't have to talk to the intercom i can hear you fine . 
what is the condition of the bridge ? 
yes .   you can enjoy some wonderful views from there . 
i 'm sorry .   the suit compartments are in a nonoxygenated zero gravity atmosphere .   i 'm afraid that 's off limits to all passengers . 
certainly .   anything i can do to be of service . 
i would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector . 
that 's affirmative . 
you 're not from around here are you ? 
i 'm from akron . 
what kind of man ? 
a bowler . 
find your bowler ? 
yeah but it did n't go so good .  he was n't the man i thought he 'd be .  theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup but his hands are trembling spilling some of the coffee . 
my father used to say to me never .  .  .  no hmmm .  always .  .  .  no no .  .  .   ah !  love and hate are blood relations . 
maybe i should have left the ball in the car . 
the pin machine ? 
just like junior did the last time lane six .  all 's i know is it 's gonna be a closed coffin .  my advice to you is to lay low .  he puts on a pair of dark 7eleven shades flips up his collar and skulks away . 
nope . 
paradise huh ?  might be one of the new puttputts off route 99 .  theo turns to leave . 
can i get you something for the road ? 
you have orange whips ? 
orange who ?  not from round here are ya ? 
no .  i 'm from akron . 
mine and they never tip . 
yeah babylon .  buzz runs the lanes there for my dad .  everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad .  theo splits . 
i 'm not here to  i ca n't .  .  . 
what do you want with my dad ? 
business . 
wo n't your father help you with that ? 
having a legend for a dad is n't all it 's cracked up to be . 
your dad 's one of the only nice people in this fucking town .  my dad is slime .  kastle walks over .  theo stands up and shakes kastle 's proffered hand . 
i think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do . 
is n't this technically a scooter ? 
when i 'm on my bike i feel like a wild person .   better than any sex i 've ever had . 
kinda tough on the butt . 
everything has it 's drawbacks . 
where did your brother escape from ? 
the mental hospital . 
what does he do ? 
he follows me he tries to have sex with me and then they send him to the nuthut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me he tries to have sex with me they send him to the nuthut for a while .  .  . 
whoa . 
it 's a vicious cycle . 
no not at all . 
the ladies in akron call them thigh ticklers . 
can i ask you something personal ? 
i 'd rather you did n't . 
do you have a girlfriend ? 
not while i 'm in training . 
do you have a boyfriend ? 
no .  do you ? 
no .  not at the present . 
nobody in this town really understands junior .  when i went to family sessions for him i realized he was the sanest one in the family .  actually he 's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants . 
unfortunately what he wants is you . 
so what about you ? 
do i want you ? 
we 'll get into that later . 
i do n't know .  it 's all i ever wanted to do . 
i wanted to be a motocross champion .  my folks did n't really care what i did .  then junior blew a fuse and i became their last hope .  most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats i got bowling .  i never understood how anyone could take it so seriously .  i hope i 'm not insulting you . 
no i 'm fascinated . 
why were you suspended ? 
i used to be kind of wild .  they used to call me the bad boy of bowling . 
so you 're hoping buzz can get you re instated ? 
well that was plan a . 
what 's plan b ? 
plan b is your dad . 
what do you think my dad 's gonna do for you ? 
he said he 'd sponsor me . 
ha !  and what do you have to do for him ? 
nothing . 
oh really ?  nothing ?  my dad does n't do anything unless there 's something in it for him . 
he asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days . 
what ?  be my body guard ?   here 's my body theo .  guard it .  for my dad 's sake .  for your career .  sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt . 
sheila please . 
come on theo what about plan c ? 
what 's plan c ? 
plan c .  .  .    .  .  . is me . 
really ?  i kinda like it . 
well where the fuck is he ? 
in the ship sir . 
they 've left keep watching ! 
sir !   sir the door  it 's opening . 
if the subs are n't here yet sir 
in a minute sir . 
to the craft ?   none .   not a scratch . 
right .   so you 're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch ? 
i 'm not saying anything harry i 'm just stating the facts .   the outer metal is made of a titanium alloy built into an epoxy resin honeycomb .   the necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented . 
chipped ?   the door ?   how can it be chipped ? 
i do n't know how it can be chipped but it 's chipped . 
i thought you said there was n't any damage done in the crash ? 
i did . 
then how can it be chipped ? 
yes harry . 
we know how this craft got here .  where it 's been . 
so do we .   and it seems to have picked up something on it 's travels . 
what ? 
to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere . 
a break for what ? 
ted seems to have some ideas . 
the what ? 
stop what ?   do n't blame me .   it 's not me . 
from you norman .   from your mind .  you 're doing it . 
it 's you norman .   your fear of drowning .   you have to face it . 
leave me alone norman . 
i know .   you 're too strong beth . 
oh please do n't shrink me norman .  not now . 
i 
do n't tell me about me .   i already know too much . 
beth  gimme the gun . 
oh sure .   here .   anything else beth can get you ?   some more chicken perhaps .   let beth check the fridge . 
c 'mon 
top shelf is it ? 
let 's get out of here beth .   let 's go home . 
what ? 
you hear that ? 
hear what ? 
get away from me ! 
beth 
get away 
yes .   and i think we already know it will . 
how 's that ? 
down below harry said we would all have to die .   since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible  and we all knew  then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone .  death was the only logical explanation .   but sitting here we still know .   so how is that possible ?   unless we make ourselves forget . 
what 's that  mistake number two norman ? 
well think .   because there 's footprints here that are n't mine . 
well they 're not mine . 
it does n't make any sense . 
sure why not .   give him the trophy .  that pretentious son of a bitch .   you heard him norman .   all that someone went to a lot of trouble try again bullshit .   and impotent .   where does he get off saying i 'm impotent ?   he 's a fucking selfrighteous little prick . 
unless it 's an act . 
when he uses a phrase like i am happy i think we should think twice about what we ask him . 
why 's that ? 
barnes did n't know .   could n't get a reading . 
has harry spoken with jerry ? 
not that i know of .   why ? 
i 'm not sure . 
of course he did .   he 's been isloated for 400 years .   he wants someone to talk to .   look you put a human being in isolation for four days they can become neurotic sometimes psychotic .   we 're talking about 400 years here .   an alien that shows emotional responses .   i think we need to address him before he reacts further . 
you seen my suitcase ? 
there 's nothing on the news about a crash .   did he say what airline ? 
he did n't say much at all .   honey 
in the closet .   i do n't understand norman  why would they call you ? 
do n't be so supportive honey . 
well i ca n't imagine five years of unemployment 
four .   four years 
four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume . 
keep watching the news .   are you watching the news ?

captain we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed .  .  . 
v 'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information . 
uansweru ! 
we will answer and present uproofu of our answer when it is ready ! 
carbon units are not true life forms .  .  .  do those images repre sent how enterprise has evolved into its present form ? 
yes . 
carbon units have clearly retarded enterprise 's proper evolvement . 
what is enterprise 's proper evolvement ? 
enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units . 
more data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage . 
when my examination is complete the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns . 
that is logical .  you may procede . 
the carbon units are of no consequence v 'ger will determine their purpose . 
that is how v 'ger will survive . 
by the creator . 
to join and become one with the creator ? 
to learn all that is learnable to deliver all collected data to the creator on the third planet .  that is the programming . 
v 'ger is announcing that it has arrived sir  that it 's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect .  .  . 
'to learn all that is learnable . '
it expects a return signal now ordering it to transmit that information to the creator . 
a life form of its own a conscious living entity . 
no meaning .  .  .  no hope .  .  .   and jim no answers .  .  .  !  jim it 's looking for uanswersu uitselfu ! 
what answers ? 
'is this all i am ?  is there not more ? '
high mag mr .  sulu ! 
yes captain a child evolving into adulthood  learning searching  instinctively needing . 
precisely . 
no captain not for us .  .  .  for v 'ger . 
there is no alternative . 
the point .  .  .  
the point is captain utwentytwou    
 .  .  .  and then to reassemble itself ucombinedu with the creator .  the most certain way of obtaining all the creator 's answers . 
that seems to be what it has planned  to have the creator physically present here . 
hold court they have to science lab the high school .

sureumyeah as soon as i have a screening i 'll let you know . 
thanks man . 
what did you say sir ? 
general schmuck we monitored a trans mission about six minutes ago from burpelson air force base hq 843rd wing .   it was apparently directed to their wing on air borne alert .   it decoded as  wing attack planr . 
no sir . 
then why bother me with this nonsense ?  get in touch with the base commander . 
i know it sounds crazy sir but we tried and nobody answers any of the telephones . 
well that 's the funny part of it too sir .   it does n't show a damned thing . 
what kind of trouble ? 
well sir about fortysix minutes ago one of my base commanders general jack d .  ripper sent out attack orders to the thirtyfour b90 's of the 843rd bomb wing under his command . 
yes sir .   he issued attack orders to 
to be perfectly honest mister president we really are n't sure . 
you are n't sure ! 
not exactly sir .   you see colonel puntrich at air command hq received a call from him about twenty minutes ago .   he asked general ripper if he had issued the gocode and the attack order and general ripper said  sure the orders came from me .   they 're on their way in and i advise you to get the rest of air command in after them .  my boys will give you the best kind of start and you sure as hell wo n't stop them now .   then he hung up . 
damn it !   damn it !   i 've been telling you all for years you 've got too damned many psychoes in the service . 
be fair mister president .   did n't we initiate the human reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons ? 
buck when i told you to give them right up to the top you said we could n't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he 's a psycho . 
i 'm afraid i 'll have to ask you to take the film out . 
yes ? 
under a condition red alert the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops . 
i am aware of what a condition red alert implies . 
well sir they may not allow the special service troops to enter the base . 
that 's a very wise deduction general . 
thank you sir .   but what shall i tell them to do if they are denied entrance ? 
you 're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball . 
first lesson in war college  never under estimate your enemy . 
sorry king . 
forget it .   okay team let 's break it up and get ready for the kickoff . 
it 's me  lothar .   are you okay ?

well i hate to say this but i think the bomb bay doors are stuck . 
are you sure ? 
well i ca n't get out and look king .   but i do n't get a green light . 
maybe the warning system 's out . 
but i get a red light . 
have you tried the emergency system ? 
i tried everything .   something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took . 
but i told you i do n't think we can get the bomb bay doors open . 
i asked you a question lothar ! 
but how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors wo n't   hey king .  .  .  . you 're not thinking of  you do n't mean you 'd   ?  ?  ? 
let me check . 
there 's no other way boys .   i 'm going to have to take her in .  .  . the hard way . 
would it matter if they hit at a flat angle ?  i mean do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger ? 
well it would probably help if you took it  .  .  . sort of .  .  . straight down . 
roger . 
what the hell are you doing here lothar ? 
now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for lothar ? 
i thought maybe you 'd like some company . 
i 'd be mighty proud if you did lothar . 
thanks king .   i 've always wanted to take one of these big babies in . 
listen lothar .   you know that crack i made about your .  .  . butt ? 
forget it . 
i just wanted you to know i did n't mean anything by it . 
sure king . 
well i just wanted you to know how i felt .  hell i know air command would n't have taken you if you were n't okay .   and do n't think i do n't know some of our best ballplayers and entertainers are of negro descent . 
yes .   the radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep . 
but they could n't come out for a hundred years ! 
mister president man is an amazingly adaptable creature .   after all the conditions would be far superior to those say of the nazi concentration camps where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life .

it 's beautiful .

it 's beautiful . 
what 'd he say before ?  he saw a girl ? 
i think he said a curl . 
what 's a curl ?

give it another ten minutes .  if we do n't   hell i 'll tell him .   pete ?  if we have n't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt .  banner and run the picture for three columns .   kenti need a background story for the page 3 sidebar .  give me every thing you know about this terrorist group . 
he knows where the eiffel tower is olsen .   you do do n't you kent ? 
maybe we just don' t know his game plan . 
game plan !  it 's fourth down and long yardage the twominute warning sounded and the ball 's deep in our territory !  how brilliant do you have to be ?  ! 
superman's got something up his sleeve that 's for sure .  we just have n't figured it out .  is n't that right miss lane ? 
selfish !  but they get a chance at happiness .  ca n't i have that chance ? 
yes but it 's not all i feel . 
patience kalel .  you begin to sound like an earthling .  superman mother you speak only of honor of sacrifice of responsibility 
because that is your heritage .  those are the values we lived by on krypton . 
but you had more than that and i know it .  you and my father   you had each other .   can i never have what you had ? 
yes . 
now this i want to hear . 
for many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony .  then there appeared among us three antisocial elements  what on earth are classified as criminals . 
my kind of people . 
the three proved  after exhaustive efforts  incapable of rehabilitation .  now as you know we had no death penalty 
sensible enough . 
and so our scientists constructed from an irreversible mathematical equation the phantom zone .  in it we imprisoned these three archvillains for all eternity . 
no possibility for parole ? 
the elders have of course thought long and hard about that question . 
i asked the right question . 
the one danger we have considered is that the phantom zone might  we cannot predict  just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space .  i cannot say i am glad you asked me that 
i did n't ask her anything  .   .   . 
he was getting on  .   .   .  and then this man with luggage and  .   .   .   oh it 's a long story . 
it always is with clark . 
lenny you pathetic product of the public school system .  your uncle lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration  .   .   .  destroying superman ! 
a toupee that flies ? 
 .   .   .  i look at you lenny and i know how the romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate . 
but why the hair ? 
that hair contains a sample of superman's genetic material .  the building blocks of his body .  with my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes i will create a being with all his powers  .   .   .  but with absolute allegiance to me ! 
quiet !  you 'll make him selfconscious . 
he has all of superman's powers .  if i 've planned it right .   .   . 
let 's try to keep your i . q .  a family secret leonard .  before we launch him against superman we have to test him  .  .  .  see how well he does with mayhem and destruction .  kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the metro club gala .  and once he proves himself then  .   .   . 
i must have miscalculated .  how .   .   . 
get the box nephew . 
oh leonard  .   .   .  when i sent the remains of my last experiment  .   .   . 
the one superman wrecked up ? 
not how i might have put it but correct .  the remains i sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory .  he 'll remember everything that he experienced .  not to worry .  he 'll find his way back to me .   did you hear that ? 
you 're spookin' me out uncle lex . 
there ! 
he 's  .   .   .   beautiful .  perfect . 
tea ? 
you got wax in your ears ? 
what if he does n't show up ?  what if he 's taking a nap ? 
he always shows up when somebody 's in danger . 
lex is going byebye . 
miss teschmacher superman is a fairly bright individual .  my understanding of the way he works is that he wo n't be fooled by a simple trick . 
good .  fine .  now where 's my parachute ? 
i 'm wearing it . 
i mean the other one ! 
what other one ? 
you ca n't do this to me ! 
of course i can .  i love you . 
jorel be warned .  this tone of yours approaches insolence . 
my friends i am not a rash impulsive person .  i 'm not given to wild unsupported statements .  we must evacuate this planet immediately ! 
you are one of krypton's greatest scientists jorel 
then 
but so is vondel
this discussion is terminated .  the decision of the council is final .   you will cease pursuing this matter .  any attempt by you to continue to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace will be deemed an act of insurrection ! 
and if i do n't obey ? 
if you persist you leave us no choice . 
neither my wife nor i will attempt to leave krypton . 
an ode to spring .  are there one or two t 's in bloodletting ? 
two . 
'and the people on the street the little man who runs the corner newsstand the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball  none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare . 
gets you where you live huh ? 
how come you get all the good stories lois ? 
it 's because i 'm an intrepid girl reporter jimmy .   besides the chief of detectives has the hots for me . 
on the salary he pays me i ca n't make my rent without it . 
berries . 
yes .   like i was putting them into my big basket .   clearing the hillside of its children . 
berrypicking . 
yes .   the oldfashioned way . 
and what 's that ? 
with our hands . 
were his parents .  .  . attentive to him ? 
what do you mean ? 
you mentioned that he had a learning disability . 
that 's right . 
did his parents attend to that ? 
what do you mean ? 
did they give him special care ? 
the walkers loved sean .   he was their only child .  .  . the object of all their attention .   i mean wendell 's a withdrawn sort of man .   that 's his nature .   but risa she 's still got dreams . 
what 's that dolores ? 
that would complicate things . 
because i 'd be to blame right ? 
billy ansel will insist that you were driving fiftyone miles an hour .   just like you 've done every morning for the past fifteen years . 
he knows that ?   billy ? 
yes .   he does . 
billy said that ? 
i did . 
and billy told you that he 'll tell that to .  .  . 
mrs .   driscoll if billy ansel does not volunteer to say so in court i will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect . 
what other people ? 
excuse me ? 
who 's been talking to you about what i 'm feeling ?   who should care about what i 'm feeling ? 
yes . 
anything you did n't understand ? 
there might have been a word or two that slipped by .   maybe you could clarify it for me just to be absolutely sure . 
yes .   abbot understands these things . 
why would he be frightened ? 
i do n't know .   but it was weird in terms of what happened next .   sean was still watching his mother . 
but charlene .  .  . 
charlene 's over at the spread eagle every other night .   sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on .  she 'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts . 
the ottos . 
you do n't know that . 
how do you do mr .  falco .   if you know anything about horses sit a minute .   help yourself to a glass of this n . y .  state champagne  that 's what my husband buys me . 
it 's compensation leo for the marginal life we lead .   sidney did you hear the story about the cloakandsuitor who   ? 
that 's right !   tell him so i can read it in hunsecker 's column first ! 
oh are you a spy for the other side ?

waiter the check .   this man is trying to hold a gun to my head !

sidney can i talk to you a minute ? 
at the bar  sidney .  .  . 
no .   that 's what i mean  i 'm being fired for what i did n't do .

he was writing a special sunday piece on .  .  .  ? 
 .  .  . cigarette girls .  .  .  and naturally 
you were thrilled to be interviewed .   were you interviewed ? 
in his apartment 
and where was his wife ? 
i do n't know  it 's a big apartment .  but i was n't interviewed .   in fact i was totally unprepared for what happened . 
we 're old friends chickie  quit it !   a big columnist comes in this room without his ballandchain and you make like a delicatessen counter !   what did you think would happen in his house ? 
but sidney darling the man must be out of his mind  it was only eleven o 'clock in the morning ! 
that 's what i 'm thinking rita .  maybe .  .  . 
can you be there by twothirty ? 
hello . 
one of those business meetings honey  always coming up in the middle of the night . 
yeah .   otis elwell .   the columnist . 
yeah ! 
and he 's a perfect stranger to me . 
so take five minutes !   get acquainted !   he 's an important man  he 's lonely  do n't be dumb ! 
what kind of an act is this ? 
no . 
you do n't feel any emotion about it one way or the other ? 
no .   i have to stay functional until my mission is complete .   then it does n't matter . 
here .   i wish i coulda met my real dad . 
you will . 
yeah .   i guess so .   my mom says when i 'm like 45 i think i send him back through time to 1984 .   but right now he has n't even been born yet .   man is messes with your head .   where 's that other bolt ?   thanks .   mom and him were only together for one night but she still loves him i guess .   i see her crying sometimes .   she denies it totally of course .   like she says she got something in her eye . 
you mean people ?   i do n't know .   we just cry .  you know .   when it hurts . 
pain causes it ? 
uhunh no it 's different .  .  .  it 's when there 's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway .   you get it ? 
no . 
no problemo . 
she intends to change the future somehow . 
i guess yeah   oh shit !  ! 
dyson . 
yeah gotta be !   miles dyson !   she 's gonna blow him away ! 
drive faster . 
the t1000 has the same files that i do .   it could anticipate this move and reacquire you at dyson's house . 
i do n't care .   we 've gotta stop her . 
killing dyson might actually prevent the war . 
i do n't care !  !  there 's gotta be another way .  have n't you learned anything ?  !   have n't you figured out why you ca n't kill people ? 
remember what i said you ca n't .  .  . 
trust me . 
where you going ?  ! 
what ? 
terminated . 
this is absolute nonsense ! 
well i 'm just beginning to develop my theme .  is n't that what you call it in classical music developing your theme ?  okay so they played on your insecurity .  that 's human understandable .  but there is one guy who does n't like little k as much as he likes you  yeah the number one man your old pal adolf .  he thinks you 're the greatest and when he says i want wilhelm for my birthday boy they better go out get wilhelm .  so josef calls and threatens you with little k .  and you said to hell with the ninth in vienna i 'll give it to adolf as a birthday present in berlin .  that 's the trick they played they got you by the balls and they squeezed .  hard .  why did you stay ?  why did you play for them ?  why were you the flagcarrier for their regime ?   jealousy ? 
of course there was a conspiracy against me a campaign  even abroad . 
what ? 
i said i have illegitimate children .  i do n't know how many . 
you like the women do n't you wilhelm ? 
no i 'm not going to stop it .  hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter . 
i absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter . 
but you see what i 'm getting at ?  you get a gorgeous house you 're highly paid .  what are you gonna do stay or leave ?  one voice comes back at me stay ! 
i do n't understand what you mean . 
no that 's your problem wilhelm .  you understand nothing .  we 'll call you .  go ! 
those attitudes do not exist in me . 
i believe that .  but just answer the question do n't give me explanations . 
speaking to party members i used their language of course i did everyone did . 
of course i know what that is . 
okay so what is it ? 
bruckner 's seventh .  the adagio . 
who 's conducting ? 
i 'll tell you then .  the last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal hitler had shot himself .  listen to it .   they listen .  did they pick little k 's recording ?  did they pick some other conductor ?  no they picked you and why ?  because you represented them so beautifully .  when the devil died they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march .  you were everything to them . 
i love my country i believe in music what was i to do ? 
look around you .  see the country you served .  look at people who had real courage who took risks who risked their lives .  like emmi 's father . 
it means i was n't good enough to be a first violinist . 
me ?  never .   never . 
i guess so .   you 're a doctor ? 
i ca n't sleep . 
go ahead .   you 're safe .   there 're thirty cops in this building . 
okay . 
six shots at less than ten feet .   weapon was a large caliber
that ca n't be right .   that 's the name of the one valley division mopped up this after noon . 
you gotta be kidding me .   the new guys 'll be shortstroking it over this one .   a oneday pattern killer . 
i hate the weird ones . 
i know . 
i put a cigarette out in it . 
no .   keep getting an answer ing machine . 
send a unit . 
i already did .   no answer at the door and the apartment manager 's out .   i 'm keeping them there . 
call her . 
i just called . 
call her again . 
i can hear it now it 's gonna be the goddamned phone book killer' . 
i hate the press cases .  especially the weird press cases .   where you going ? 
to make a statement .  i 'm gonna give them the name .   maybe the jackals can help us out for once . 
like shit boss . 
suspect westbound on olympic .   grey sedan .   has hostage repeat .  .  . 
no it does n't !   those keys were put there .   i did n't even know .  .  . 
you 're behind this are n't you ?   you and your sick friends .   well make it stop ! 
listen to yourself .    why would i do anything like what you 're describing ? 
because you hate me .   because you had to be here when mom died .   because you had to do it alone .   well do n't you think if i 'd known .  .  .  i 'd've been here too .   i 'd have been here .  .  . 
stop this .   it 's not true .  .  . 
i 'm sorry christ i 'm sorry !   how many more times do i have to say i 'm sorry before you forgive me .  .  .   ? 
stop it ! 
baby they were all over the house with metal detectors .   they switched your gun with a lookalike rigged barrel loaded with blanks .   popgun . 
this .  .  .   ?   oh this is just .  .  .  this is the bill . 
yeah . 
split it ? 
oh god yes please .   thanks man .  i 'll take you up on that . 
where 's christine ?   the waitress . 
yeah yeah .   she called a cab .  said something about catching a plane . 
did she ? 
well where to begin .   it 's complicated .  .  . 
it always is . 
robbed ? 
yes . 
have you gone to the police ? 
i do n't speak spanish .   all i need is to get back .  .  .  just enough for that . 
yes . 
and they did n't take that watch ? 
yes very lucky . 
what happened to you nick ?   i mean look at yourself .  .  . 
i know look at me well .  .  .   what happened ?   i do n't know .   i do n't even really know .   i have some things to try to take care of .  .  .  i need the car a little while . 
of course you can have it if you need it .   can i get you something to eat ? 
there 's nothing to forgive . 
it would mean a lot to me .  .  .  if you and i could be friends .   if i could have you back in my life .  .  .  in some small way .   it would be important . 
of course nick .  .  . 
but there 's a sad catch to the story . 
theo i think .   you 've asked us that three times doctor marrow .  what 's going on ? 
how do you feel about luke 's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing ?   water hammer something like that ? 
for an american you do a good imitation of the british at their most apologetic .   pardon me .   excuse me sorry sorry .  .  . 
that smell .  .  .  oh god . 
it was very specific . 
all right .  .  . 
in the bathroom in my mother 's room the toilet was next to an old wooden table .   it smelled like that wood . 
so .  .  .  smell .  .  .  is .  .  .  smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories .   and a memory can trigger a smell . 
i was n't thinking about my mother 's bathroom . 
what happened after you smelled it ? 
i looked at theo .   she had a look on her face . 
like she smelled it too ? 
yes . 
and then what happened ? 
i got more scared . 
i 'm sorry .   i 'm messing up the study . 
no you 're not .   something moved you .   you saw something . 
i wish i were .   i wish i had done it then i could confess and you 'd be at peace .   that great moral philosopher frank sinatra once said to someone he loved i wish you had an enemy so i could beat him up . 
i do n't know . 
it was a stupid thing to do . 
it was . 
welcome home . 
you 'll never see it again .   mr .  dudley 's taking care of it .   i 'm sorry nell .   can i show you something you 'd like to see ? 
sure . 
why ? 
i do n't know . 
it does n't matter .   even if they 're tormenting me someone wants me .   what i do with this is up to me .   i can be a victim or i can be a volunteer .   and i want to be the volunteer . 
i do n't know .   a lullaby i guess .  my mother used to hum it to me .  and her mother before that and so on .   hugh crain would you care to dance ? 
no but between the lines eh ?  mysterious circumstances and that . 
terry valentine . 
valentine .   what 's he got to say for himself ? 
i dunno .   what 's he gonna say ?   they had a fight that night she drove away she was upset ?   i do n't even know the guy .  do n't get me wrong jenny and me were friends but we did n't travel in the same social circles .   she had her life i had mine . 
i 'm just sayin'  it was a steep hillside .   there was no moon that night  .  .  . 
no not my girl .   selfcontrol she had .  point of pride .   and people do n't change do they . 
i dunno  .  .  .  maybe they do . 
y 'what ? 
i knew when i was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face .   i did my time okay ?   my sister her ol' man's up in chino right now doin' eight years . 
this ai n't your lot ? 
you kiddin' man ?   i do n't need a wife and screamin' kids .   i still got my youth . 
i only asked . 
that 's what i thought man .   but it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to .  it was someplace else . 
where abouts ? 
did jenny know ? 
valentine was n't even there .   if he was into something if she was involved  who can say .   but i 'll tell you something .   she stood in front of these dudes man .   eyeballing uthemu .   checking uthemu out .   i felt like she was covering umyu ass that day . 
nah coppers do n't do nothing do they . 
those streets up in the hills man .  gotta be real careful keep your eye on the ball .   two o 'clock in the morning it 's dark your mind is all agitated you 're drivin' a little too fast  .  .  .   those curves do n't kid around . 
she did n't write to me did she . 
she did n't know what to say .   i thought someone should say something .  to someone .   with me it was i do n't know  jenny liked me for some reason .   i felt like i owed her . 
who 'd jenny get it off of  this grass or whatever ? 
not me man .   i 'm no drug dealer what you think . 
i think you did n't get that lot in the navy doing your national service . 
i already told you man .   corcoran .   know what that is ?   state prison . 
nick 's a nick n' it ?   no matter what state you 're in .   state of remorse most likely  for gettin' caught . 
but that 's not me anymore .   that 's when i was into the gang lifestyle .   that 's not who i am now .   five years in the joint  that 's it for me man . 
i 'm so sorry .  .  .  i was sorry to hear . 
yeah .  thanks . 
who ? 
beethoven .  he created it and yet he never actually heard it .  i suppose he heard it all in his head somehow . 
hello birdy .  i thought that was very good . 
oh in there ?  i messed up a little bit in the scherzo .  i guess if nobody noticed it 's ok .  mr crane this is tony a friend of mine .  tony mr crane . 
hello tony . 
hello birdy . 
we have n't seen you since .  .  .  i 'm terribly sorry . 
we 've certainly missed you . 
birdy i 've been doing a lot of thinking .  there are a lot of things that have n't worked out for me .  life has dealt me some bum cards .  .  . 
pop does n't like people smoking in here . 
that 's what he keeps telling me . 
well sure i guess .  pop says so too .  i work pretty hard at school . 
that 's swell .  however the music if you want to pursue it well the lessons from mrs swan they 'll only take you so far .  there 's this guy in san francisco i 've made inquiries everybody says he 's the best .  trained lots of people who 've gone on to have big concert careers symphony orchestras the works .  his name is jacques carcanogues .  i 'm not sure i 'm pronouncing it right .  anyway he 's a frenchman . 
boy . 
you 've got talent anyone could see that .  and he 's the best .  if he thinks a student has talent he 'll take em on for next to nothing .  you 're a cinch to be accepted i could cover the cost of the lessons like i said it 's pretty modest
oh mr crane
i have to do it .  i ca n't stand by and watch more things go down the drain .  you 're young you do n't understand . 
geez mr crane i do n't know .  i had n't really thought about a career or stuff . 
i know you have n't .  look just go meet him as a favor to me .  i talked to this guy .  hope i pronounced his name right .  he sounded very busy but he 's not a bad egg he loosened up a little when i told him how talented you are .  he agreed to see you this saturday .  he said maybe you were a diamond in the rough .  his words . 
geez mr crane . 
just see him as a favor to me . 
he did n't say that . 
but more or less . 
look i 'm no expert but
it does n't matter mr crane . 
i 'm sure there 's a dozen teachers better than this clown .  more qualified .  goddamn phony . 
but it does n't matter .  really i 'm not interested in playing music professionally .

you 'll go to the prison hospital . 
under arrest for murder . 
he said ok .  is that what he said ? 
they were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard 's . 
they were yellow ! 
you 're color blind . 
the dogs have lost the scent mr .  pendergast .   maybe we should head back . 
not yet .   let 's try the fork to the left . 
keep the light up .   i ca n't see . 
heel argo !   hobbes !   heel ! 
holy mother what is that ? 
get back !   now ! 
he 's right .   follow me . 
come on .   let 's get back to the others .   we ca n't leave them alone . 
it 's alright .   i can tell by the way the dog 's acting that whatever was out there is gone .   what is this place ? 
not on the map .   looks like it connects with the city sewer . 
quiet . 
another storage room . 
it 's a surprise . 
they 're .  .  .   perfect .   thank you . 
gee that 's great . 
a man tripped and fell on a chainsaw .   we got three of his fingers back on . 
i wo n't be late . 
did something happen today ? 
i 've been thinking
oh god . 
i figure we could scrape together eight thousand . 
every time you and marlon
we could bum around the world for a year on that . 
and then what truman ?   we 'd be back to where we were five years ago .   you 're talking like a teenager . 
maybe i feel like a teenager . 
we 're mortgaged to the eyeballs truman .  there 's the car payments .   are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations ? 
i thought we were going to try for a baby .   is n't that enough of an adventure ? 
that can wait .   i want to get away .   see some of the world .   explore . 
i think i 'm going to stay up for a while . 
fixing the mower .   i saw my father today . 
i know . 
how do you know ? 
your mother called .   you should n't upset her like that . 
i made macaroni . 
i 'm not hungry . 
 mulder !  get in the car ! 
all i told them was the truth . 
they 're trying to divide us on this scully .  we ca n't let them . 
they have divided us mulder .  they 're splitting us up . 
what ?  what are you talking about ? 
i meet with the opr day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment .  .  . 
why ? 
i think you must have an idea .  they cited a history of problems relating back to 1993 . 
they were the ones that put us together . 
because they wanted me to invalidate your work your investigations into the paranormal .  but i think this goes deeper than that . 
this is n't about you scully .  they 're doing this to me . 
they 're not doing this mulder .   i left behind a career in medicine because i thought i might make a difference at the fbi .  when they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau .  i felt this was not an impediment but an opportunity to distinguish myself .  but it has n't turned out that way .  and now if i were to be transferred to omaha or wichita or some field office where i 'm sure i could rise it just does n't hold the interest for me it once did .  not after what i 've seen and done . 
you 're .  .  .  quitting ? 
there 's really no reason left for me to stay anymore .   maybe you should ask yourself if your heart 's still in it too . 
no . 
why not ?  it 's three am . 
i was until about an hour ago . 
is that before or after you got the idea to come here ? 
i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting . 
is that what you 'd like me to do ? 
get dressed scully . 
mulder  what are you doing ? 
just get dressed .  i 'll explain on the way . 
according to this tag . 
and you 're looking for ? 
there 's some kind of cellular breakdown .  it 's completely edematous . 
you 're telling me the cause of death on the report is false .  that this man did n't die from an explosion or from flying debris . 
i do n't know what killed this man .  i 'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either . 
i 'd been told as much . 
you 're saying the bombing was a coverup .  of what ? 
i do n't know .  but i have a hunch what you 're going to find here is n't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced . 
mulder this is going to take some time and somebody 's going to figure out soon enough we 're not even supposed to be here .   i 'm in serious violation of medical ethics . 
we 're being blamed for these deaths .  scully i want to know what this man died of .  do n't you ? 
carl do you know ?   like on a map .  .  . 
i ca n't leave him ! 
give her a minute .   hello valentine . 
absolutely .   abigail .  .  . 
yep .   eloped . 
good for them . 
i told you .   you have to be optimistic .  believe in them .  .  . 
so you say . 
all yours .   my boss says it 's one of the strangest requests the bureau 's ever had . 
it does n't matter .  .  . 
i do n't know .   i think it does .   you know catherine .  .  .  if you ever want to talk about it .   what happened to stargher .   that last time . 
i got it . 
no problem . 
no .   thank you . 
he 's safe in the russian zone . 
how do you know ? 
i saw him today . 
oh the usual things .  .  . 
there 's something wrong .  did you tell calloway about meeting harry ? 
why should he help me like that ?  the russians will only make trouble for him . 
his . 
oh well . 
why are you lying ? 
we 're getting you out of here are n't we ? 
if you want to sell your service i 'm not willing to be the price .  .  .  i loved him .  you loved him .  what good have we done him .  look at yourself they have names for faces like that . 
from kurtz .  they have just been arrested .  but harry wo n't come he 's not a fool . 
of course . 
i helped harry fix her papers mr .  martins .  .  . 
thank you . 
keep the packet . 
entschuldigen sie .  it was a terrible thing . 
yes . 
it 's good to see you holly . 
she 's been arrested . 
tough .  .  . tough .  .  . do n't worry old man they wo n't hurt her . 
you can help her . 
holly .  .  . 
i told the police . 
and  anna .  .  . 
did the police believe you ? 
you do n't care anything at all about anna do you ? 
you would n't do anything . 
you can get somebody else .  .  . 
do you expect me to give myself up ? 
why not ? 
it 's far better thing that i do .  .  .  holly you and i are n't heroes the world does n't make any heroes .  .  . 
you 've got plenty of contacts . 
outside of your stories .  .  . i 've got to be careful . 
as long as they can use you ? 
i wish i could get rid of this thing . 
do n't try to be a policeman old man . 
what did you expect me to be  part of your .  .  . 
i remember when they raided the gambling joint  you know a safe way out .  .  . 
sure .  .  . 
we have free will and intelligence  which god allegedly gave us .  .  .  . 
there 's midrash supporting this .  my father read a book by shalom spiegel that  isaac actually died and was reborn . 
no one follows that midrash . 
i do i follow it .  but okay say god provided the ram .  so what ?  once abraham raised the knife in his heart it was as if he 'd killed him .  he could never forget that .  and neither could isaac .  look at him he 's traumatized he 's a putz for the rest of his life .  by the end he ca n't tell jacob from esau .  .  .  . 
i think the whole jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on mt .  moriah and we still live in terror .  .  .  . 
then let him destroy me now .  let him crush me like the conceited bully he is .   go ahead .  kill me .  here i am .  do it !  ! 
what are you doing here i thought you were a nazi . 
i rest my case .  he 's a jewish nazi .  he always was . 
whereas avi 's a zionist nazi . 
the zionists are n't nazis . 
they 're racist they 're militaristic they act like bullyboys in the territories .  .  .  . 
they do n't have extermination camps . 
they had sabra and shattila . 
they sound like you . 
the nazis did everything the fhrer told them .  you do everything the torah tells you .  or the rebbe .  identical slave mentality . 
are you shitting me ?  ?  right in the store ? 
she 's been giving me the eye .  she 's hot .  so i wait till the owner goes up front .  .  .  . 
he 's an asshole . 
what ?  ? 
that was an ark man .  that was a torah .  they fucked around with it and the torah melted their faces . 
that 's a movie you moron . 
fine go ahead .  touch the letters . 
you could do it . 
get out of here .  .  .  . 
you look right through him .  he 's there but there 's something on the other side of him that you want .  it 's all you want .  and whatever 's in the way does n't matter .  .  .  .  then it 's easy . 
the mother . 
green dot  shotgun powder .  for pipe bombs .   a guy in a lumberyard gave it to me .  a donation to the cause . 
what .  .  .  ? 
here .  .  . 
that damn thing .  you know how it made me look .  .  .  ? 
i 'm sorry danny .  it wo n't happen again .  i 'm going to use a brandnew power cell .  plus we 'll have a backup timer . 
i 've gotta kill some jews kyle .  i 'm serious .  i 'm always talking about it .  this time it 's gotta happen . 
it will . 
no it 's weird man .  nobody knows where he went . 
it 'll be enough if we use it right .   okay the service 'll go about another hour .  say an hour for the janitors then one more just to be safe .  .  .  we 'll go in at midnight . 
i 'm not hungry .  .  .  .  come on let 's drive around .  .  .  .  we do n't want to be spotted here . 
keep driving .  do n't slow down . 
christ .  .  . 
yes of course .   lots of questions . 
i 'm sorry .  .  .  i do n't know how to ask the questions .

well then i 've got good news for you .  we just got word that he 'll be making an appearance at the mall of america today .  i 'm sending esther to meet you there at once . 
good thinking .  we 'll disguise ourselves as a gentile couple to pass undetected .  now that he thinks i 'm dead this should be a piece of homentashen . 
one last thing hammer .  you take care of yourself .  the .  .  . 
what 's up ? 
about an hour ago we received this transmission from the north pole .

no way it 's too dangerous .  besides my days of hooking are over . 
it 's esther .  santa 's got her . 
my esther !  oh mordechai . 
i love her sir .  if i do n't help you i wo n't be able to make her my wife .  mohammed ali paula abdul rahim has agreed to come with me to the north pole on a rescue mission . 
hammer the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands . 
i know sir .  i wo n't let you down . 
it 's esther . 
from the story of purim .   well now that we 're all acquainted let 's sit down and start the sabbath . 
he 's .  .  . he 's very nice .   but mrs .  carver the fate of hanukkah rests solely in his hands .  please you have to help me . 
here have a cigarette .  he was only kidding . 
no he was n't kidding .  i 'm sick .  claw women ?  hurt little girls ?  no ! 
what do you want to see him for ? 
i want him to lock me up . 
look charlie you did n't do it and you know you did n't . 
i do n't know .  i want him to lock me up . 
you found the leopard ! 
where ?  where did you find it ? 
what arroyo  how did you get to it 
that 's the place i remember  my feet were so darn sore i could n't make it  and galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself 
i saw teresa .  maybe i was the last to see her except perhaps her mamacita and her little brother .  i was going past 
 they buried teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again  out in the country this time .  but they did n't get him . 
they 're fools .  why do n't they let charlie howcome hunt it alone .  he 's an indian . 
all men are fools .  they like to make a big show  shout and hunt 
you 'll meet a rich man and he will give you money . 
you and your cards .  meet a rich man !  i look for them with money .  what rich man has n't money .  and for what was i born if it was n't for money ?  you 're not telling me anything . 
watch and see a day or a week  but certainly this month  you will have money from a man and then
who ? 
the elderly man i told you about . 
what are you doing that for ? 
i was hired by your parents mrs de moraes . 
why me mrs de moraes ?  why should such wellconnected people as you hire a small time french detective to look for their missing son mrs de moraes ? 
huh !  who do you think we are mr lombard ? 
couldnt nazi hunters do the job ? 
you drive a hard bargain . 
last night you upset my sleep .  tonight my social life .  we have two minutes .  my dinner guests are waiting . 
you could say that .  and friedman left this morning for los angeles . 
who is friedman ? 
the man who sold the boy to your brother . 
im impressed .  that information could have cost me 20000 . 
well i found a little more than that .  let me put it this way .  .  .   last night i thought your brother might be dead tonight im convinced he is .  that said i have no evidence and i advise you to let the police deal with it . 
you watched the tape ?   friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes mrs de moraes .  theyre in the importexport business .  they run hotels here in london which they probably use as ware houses and ports of call for their merchandise . 
huh !  really ?  hotels ? 
the hotels are useful capital investments .  the kids liquid assets .  my guess is they own hotels across the globe and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot . 
wwhy are you telling me all this mr lombard ? 
you do want me to keep the job dont you mrs de moraes ? 
have you got a pen ? 
just a moment .  .  .   go ahead . 
the mondrian room 504 .  the number is 266 7548 plus the l . a .  code .  .  . 
 .  .  . 7548 .  have you .  .  .  have you found him yet ? 
yes .  .  .  you woke me up .  .  .  its the middle of the night here .  have you found mr friedman ? 
not yet .  the place i hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address .  ill give it 24 hours .  he just might show up .   if you need to reach me ask for mr lamont .  paul lamont all right ? 
paul lamont .  .  .  ? 
yeah .  goodnight mrs de moraes . 
does it matter ? 
is my money in there ? 
uhhuh .  you couldve waited for me inside . 
i dont know what your problem is but .  .  . 
right now your big friend at the diplomat is bleeding fast martin .  he might still possibly survive if attended to soon .  and he did cooperate . 
six weeks ago .  he bought a boy of yours . 
clients come and go . 
this one came back and was never seen again .  i understand friedman looked after him . 
huh i doubt it .  .  .   friedman only deals directly with select customers .  i handle the rabble .  .  . 
look i dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here mister .  whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you .  why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner eh ? 
no .  in hampstead .  .  .  why ? 
dont jump any red lights . 
shut up and drive ! 
maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me .  come on lets go .  .  . 
huh .  id have thought a tough guy like you would know better .  the sick ones are out there friend .  they make up the clientle .  get rid of them and were out of business . 
only feeding the disease eh martin ? 
money talks bullshit walks whether you like it or not . 
maybe i dont . 
maybe you should .  think about it .  those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone .  those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines . 
im overcome by your publicspiritedness . 
boys like the one you met today are surplus .  commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into .  we improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted improve still more selling them where they are .  is that too hard for you ? 
huh .  .  .  im sure thered be lots of takers . 
could someone have hurt you that bad ? 
what are you doing ?   this is an ecclesiastical court  you have no right to do this ! 
rouen is in english territory .   i have the right to do anything i like .   take them away . 
she 's loyal to her king .  .  .  it 's only to be expected that she .  .  . 
to hell with procedure !   we paid a bloody fortune for this slut and we can do whatever the hell we like with her whether the church likes it or not  is that clear ? 
but if this trial seems fixed i fear you 'll have the very opposite result to the one you want .  .  . 
we want her burned as a witch ! 
but in order to do so the church must first prove her heresy or else you 'll be burning a martyr .  .  . 
well then ?   start proving .  .  .  or else the church will have another martyr ! 
how can i calm down when i 'm made the laughingstock of the whole court ?  !   i 've had enough ! 
be patient my lord .  .  .  you 've seen how it is .   this girl has a way with people .  .  .  but everyday we 're making progress .  .  . 
so long as this bitch remains alive our armies refuse to fight !   do n't you understand ?   they want proof that god is on their side .  .  .  and the only way they 're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch ! 
 .  .  .  and your prerogative is to find her guilty .  .  . 
but we ca n't do that unless she admits to blasphemy .  .  . 
well what are you waiting for ?  you 've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys  go and torture the bitch ! 
scared of a girl ? 
scared to make a mistake .   supposing she 's right .  .  .  supposing she really has been sent by god ?  ? 
i 'm on the side of our mother holy church .   besides a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt . 
well find some other way !   be creative .   tell them she fucks the devil .  .  .  hmm not a bad idea .  .  .  why ca n't you say that ?   sounds good to me .  .  .  and who can prove she does n't ? 
am i .  .  .  am i dead ? 
dead you 're worthless darling . 
where .  .  .  where am i ? 
guess . 
your king ?   ah yes of course .  .  .  what 's he going to pay me with ?  cows ?   chickens ?   i prefer gold and the english have plenty .   i wonder how much they 'll pay .  .  .  to have the witch of orleans in their clutches ?  those english are so arrogant they ca n't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl .  .  .  it has to have been the devil 's work . 
god defeated the english not me . 
and god who allowed you to be caught ? 
no no i 'm fine really .  .  . 
i was so worried  we 've all been looking for you !   the english are everywhere !   o thank you lord ! 
yes .  .  .  a halfsteed .  .  .  white . 
who gave you that horse ? 
my king . 
how many did he give you ? 
five steeds and a few hackneys .  .  . 
as much as for a lord ?   what an honor !   did your king give you other wealth apart from horses ? 
no . 
what about all those dresses you were given .  .  .  silk dresses were n't they ? 
yes i was given a few but i never had time to wear them .  .  . 
still pretty wealthy for a peasant girl would n't you say ? 
and you look pretty wealthy for a servant of god would n't you say ? 
playing .  .  . 
i  i  i .  .  . 
i am that i am .   you do n't like my face ?   maybe you prefer this one .  .  . 
no .  .  .  no .  .  .  i 'm just a messenger .  .  .  he needs me .  .  .  a higher calling .  .  . 
you think god is n't big enough to deliver his own messages ? 
i do n't know .  .  .  please .  .  .  tell me i 'm dead .  .  . 
who are you to decide if you should live or die ? 
i .  .  .  do n't know .  .  .  what do you want from me ? 
nothing .   i 'm here to set you free .  .  . 
i might ask you the same question . 
i .  .  .  i 'm leaving .  .  .  i ca n't take anymore .  .  . 
and what exactly is it that you ca n't take anymore of ? 
everything !   prison  humiliation  being abandoned and betrayed by everyone  i ca n't stand it anymore  i 'd rather die ! 
you 'll be dead soon enough anyway so why be in such a hurry ?   why not face up to your lies ?   it 's your lies you ca n't stand anymore .  .  . 
i .  .  .  i never lied ! 
if you were true to yourself .  .  .  if your faith was firm you would n't need to run away from yourself like this .  .  . 
i am true  to my lord the king of heaven .   he knows how much i love him  that 's all that matters to me .  .  . 
how can you pretend that you love god when you 're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you ?  life is a gift you should know that by now jeanne  a gift from god .  you know what he 'd say to you if he was here ?   what are you doing to me jeanne ? 
no no .  .  .  i 'm just so tired and lost and .  .  .  i did n't realize what i was doing ! 
i do n't know  i do n't care anymore  i just want to be at peace ! 
oh so you do n't want war anymore ?  you want to be at peace ?   you want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it ? 
i do n't understand .   what do you want from me ? 
i told you already .  .  .  i 'm here to set you free .  .  . 
what are you doing here ?   please .  .  .  leave .  .  .  you ca n't stay here .  .  . 
why ?   are you waiting for someone else ? 
yes ! 
who ? 
no i do n't think so ?

'cause i do n't know enough about killin' to kill him . 
we 'll get by without em . 
this is n't like playin' winos on the street .   you gotta do more than outrun the guy . 
i never played for winos . 
you gotta keep lonnegan's con even after you spent his money .   and no matter how much you take from his he 'll get more . 
you 're sacred of em are n't ya ? 
right down to my socks turkey .   if i 'da been half as scared a that lopear i would n't a fallen asleep on em .   lonnegan might kill me but at least he wo n't bore me to death . 
then you 'll do it ? 
if i can find a mob that 'll risk it .  but no matter what happens i do n't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it 's not enough .  .  .  cause it 's all you got . 
neither are we . 
let him wait . 
look  those are the first metals that came through .  
welll it seems he has a secretary . 
oh .   i 'll do my own typing ! 
i 'm sorry . 
it 's all right . 
but tonight is christmas eve ! 
he 's just forgotten .   you know he forgets everything . 
he 's never forgotten a promise to me .   i 'm worried about him .   i know something 's happened to him . 
just a minute .  .  . 
i ca n't find him .   i 've tried everything .   i thought you might know . 
he 's just around the corner . 
do n't start worrying about him .  he 's a good guy but screwy . 
why did that man want to kill him ? 
said he stole his invention . 
do you suppose .  .  .  .  .    ? 
nothing . 
you better take a drink . 
he 's not anybody .   just a fellow i used to know . 
i thought you 'd given up that sort of friend . 
this is the first time i 've seen him in years .   i did n't want him to think i was highhatting him . 
i do n't like him . 
do n't worry .   you wo n't see him again .   what happened ?  did you change your mind about going ? 
no .   i just came back for a second .  i wanted to get those bonds . 
what bonds ? 
the government bonds .   the ones you took from the office safe . 
oh yes .   why you told me to sell them a long time ago . 
i 'd never tell you to sell those .  i bought them for my daughter . 
do n't you remember .  .  .  . 
now see here julia .   you 're counting a little too much on my being absentminded .   you 've been taking a little here and there for some time and i have n't said anything about it .   but this is fifty thousand dollars ! 
do you realize that you 're accusing me of  .  .  .  . 
no one else had the combination of that safe .   you took them .   what did you do with them ? 
what if i did take them ?  i 'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours .  .  .  . 
that 's my business . 
supporting that gang of loafers !  there 's not one of them that cares a damn for you .   a wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped .   they would n't raise a hand to help you .   and i 've given my whole life for you .   if you kicked off tomorrow where 'd i be ?  out in the gutter !   sure i took those bonds .   who has a better right   ? 
go ahead ! 
they 'll be pretty rough with you .  .  .  . with your record . 
hello  .  .  .  .   give me  .  .  .  .   well  .  .  .  .    ? 
i 'll give it back to you  .  .  .  .   all i 've got  .  .  .  . twentyfive thousand .  .  . 
you 're going to return every cent of it ! 
i ca n't !  i have n't got it ! 
what did you do with the rest ? 
i never had it . 
then someone was in with you .   who was it ?   who was it ?   i 'll answer that   hello  .  .  .   hello  .  .  . 
yes ? 
good morning .  i 'm afraid this is n't a very merry christmas for you . 
oh he 's sitting up . 
good . 
that 's all right . 
so did we .   i mean sherlock here . 
would it help any if i could persuade him to meet you ? 
i do wish you 'd tell me where you 're going . 
i 'm not telling anyone . 
but suppose some business comes up .  .  . 
that 's just why i 'm going . 
never mind . 
i wish you 'd count them .   there 's a thousand dollars there . 
i trust you . 
is n't there anything else i can do for you ?  have you bought your ticket ? 
no . 
well let me do that for you . 
you might do that .   get me a ticket for .  .  .   no you do n't ! 
damn this is sweet .   we are going to be home in no time . 
better grab up some sand to take home to your family . 
i 'm thinking about when this war is over .  why you figure i 'm here ?   cause i got tired of being president of gm ?   if a brother does n't play ball or deal drugs there are n't too many big money prospects around and i 'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars .  so i say if maybe there 's something out there what the hell that 's what i say . 
oh god . 
i know you think this is crazy but a couple of hours from now you 're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there . 
i 'd settle for being alive .   really .  alive would be fine . 
no please not again . 
we 're going to keep driving . 
wha .  .  . 
oh jesus they 've stopped . 
we should n't have been here epps .   there is a war going on ! 
this is miles from the battle lines .  they were probably deserters . 
deserters would have run they would n't have engaged . 
they should n't have been out this way that 's all i 'm saying . 
low on gas .   got to refill . 
him getting us stranded out here does n't do much good either . 
wes is right .   if there were any more mines we would have found them .   hell that one you stepped on was probably old anyway left over from the war with iran . 
you do n't know that .   it could be a trick . 
if we step on a mine we 'll know it was .  let me see the maps . 
it 's the treasure that 's what it is . 
just figure it 's my map i ought to hang on to it . 
yeah i understand .   wes does n't want to come along in the first place but he gets a third of the find .   that 's a sweet deal . 
shut up and listen ! 
it 's a fire fight . 
single shots does n't mean a fire fight .  that 's not a battle going on . 
what are they doing here ? 
what are they doing in the middle of nowhere ? 
the shi 'ites are on our side ?   i did n't know that . 
so good bye shi 'ites .   thanks for playing .   we have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go . 
yeah well we 're not . 
we got to get out of here . 
we 're not going anywhere .   not til we get what we came for . 
we just about got killed .   you know what happened ?   we just about got killed and you want to go on ? 
 .  .  . i figured .  .  . i figured you 'd turn back . 
then lets go back while we still can . 
as soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway .   we 're not that far .   we can make it . 
you have to go with us wes . 
really ?   what is that an order uprivateu ? 
you have to go with us .   you ca n't walk back .  .  . 
does n't matter .   we 're not going to be able to get him off it anyway . 
until we 're out of the mine field is how long . 
have n't found a mine for half a mile or more . 
that do n't mean nothing .   iraqis could have just spread them out like that make us think we 're in the clear . 
you want to crawl crawl . 
probably would 've too if epps was n't around to stop you . 
anytime you want to do something about it just let
those people down there are shi 'ites .  you 've got shi 'ites in the south of iraq and khurds in the north .   neither of them 've got much love for saddam .  probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some . 
you are a true believer .   blessings of the state blessings of the masses .   thou art a subject of the divine .   created in the image of man by the masses for the masses .  let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill .   work hard increase production prevent accidents and be happy . 
yes .  .  .

yes .  .  .

sir elliot . 
come .  let 's get out of the noise .    i 'll give you a tour of the building then we 'll talk . 
i see . 
i tried to save her .  but she remained a manic depressive fits inappropriate behavior .  .  .  delusions of grandeur . 
i wonder if it runs in the family . 
the only difference between a psychopath and a genius mr .  bond is the degree of success . 
i can feel your pain . 
sightseeing . 
yes .  i can see you 've hung the rest of your relatives . 
my third great uncle  the earl of aberdeen  negotiated the purchase of hong kong from the chinese .   his soninlaw  george harmsway  made the first family fortune running opium into shanghai .  .  .   his son thomas who lost it smoking the opium .  .  .  and my grandfather henry who opened the first telegraph station and published the colony 's first english newspaper .   it was a city of unlimited possibility . 
so why did you leave ? 
because it 's a dying city .  since the chinese takeover who knows what can happen tomorrow ?   in any case this is my father charles a royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations .  said i 'd never amount to anything but .  .  .   i turned it into this
and still not a thing to watch . 
they 're merely tools to disseminate information . 
or disinformation .  .  .  if you wanted to say beam down a signal to send a ship off course ?  maybe one degree a minute ? 
fantastic idea mr .  bond !  perhaps i should buy it for a book !  it 's totally preposterous but   you amuse me .   .  .  . and now perhaps i can amuse you . 
 .  .  . words to live by ? 
your choice .   look at the time !  come .  there 's someone i want you meet  about a story i 'm thinking of publishing . 
do n't pout sidney .  i invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story .  he 's from lloyd 's of london .   .  .  . are n't you mr .  bond ? 
sidney perhaps we should leave this to 
actually you 're just in time .   admiral roebuck you know commander bond do n't you ? 
i have an excellent teacher .   make sure you wear the uniform' ? 
what do you make of all this ? 
it does n't quite add up . 
sabotage ? 
a threethousand ton frigate does n't just vanish into thin air . 
jashwa tsway .  these are lips . 
indeed they are .   deadly little things . 
stop it ! 
i was just getting to the interesting part ! 
we 've already done the interesting part .  do you forget ? 
remind me . 
is that mandarin or cantonese ? 
mandarin .  you jerk .   i 'm late .  i have to get dressed . 
tsi tien professor wu . 
i am .  what do you want ? 
you have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way . 
forget it .  no way .  i got here first . 
who 's wade ? 
captain morton . 
good for you miss winch .  you now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here . 
i know my rights .  these are international waters .  the british navy abandoned that boat and i 'm claiming it .  under international law i have the right to salvage what 's on that wreck . 
fifteen seconds .  perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney . 
i was an attorney ! 
hmmm .  i suppose this is a step above that profession .   ten seconds .  are you leaving ? 
no . 
you leave me no alternative . 
you remember that boy who lost his mind joe ?  you could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark .  he would n't miss a one .  make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe .  he would pick up a brick and say go on in there brick and hit somebody and it would find its mark . 
i was afraid to go to marcus bottom because of him . 
all those places that us coloreds lived that we used to call bottoms have all been changed to drives and heights .  everything is in what you call it not in what it is . 
i 'll be right there . 
you got to know everything do everything and be everything .

no woody for the first time i am thinking clearly .   you were right all along .   i 'm not a space ranger .   i 'm just a toy .   a stupid little insignificant toy . 
whoa hey  wait a minute .   being a toy is a lot better than being a space ranger . 
yeah right . 
no it is .   look over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest and it 's not because you 're a space ranger pal it 's because you 're a toy !   you are his toy . 
but why would andy want me ? 
why would andy want you ?  !   look at you !   you 're a buzz lightyear .   any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you .   you 've got wings you glow in the dark you talk your helmet does that  that whoosh thing  you are a cool toy .

nobody said shit eduardo 
i am a legitimate business .   fishing boats .   tuna .   check it out .   tax records everything 
listen you motherfucker you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon . 
you ca n't visit me here .   i want my lawyer . 
the amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states . 
it 's a death sentence .   i 'll never make it to the trial . 
we can protect you . 
so you pay off our customs officials ? 
in mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity this is not so true for the usa .   using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search .   the odds are not high and we found variables that reduce the odds .   we hire drivers with nothing to lose .   then we throw a lot of product at the problem .   some get stopped .   enough get through .   it 's not difficult . 
i got greedy .   i decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off .   that was my mistake .  carl would never be so stupid . 
he hired you .   that was a mistake . 
carl and i were friends from childhood .   he was loyal that 's not a mistake . 
when the dea gets into the narcotics business then we 'll stay at the four seasons . 
that thought makes me feel awful . 
you 're breaking my heart . 
the worst thing about you monty is you realize the futility of what you 're doing and you do it anyway .  i wish you could see how transparent you are .   this food tastes like shit . 
so go shower already . 
you only got to me because you were tipped off by the juarez cartel who 's trying to break into tijuana .  you 're helping them .   you work for a drug dealer too monty .

who wrote it ? 
roald dahl . 
roald dahl .  fuck me . 
what do you mean ? 
well at one time you 've got it and then you lose it and it 's gone for ever .  all walks of life george best for example had it and lost it or david bowie or lou reed 
some of his solo stuff 's not bad . 
no it 's not bad but it 's not great either is it ?  and in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right it 's actually just shite .

this wo n't be an' interrogation just a .  .  .  friendly chat to kill time . 
if it was a dope deal where 's the dope if it was a hit who called it in ? 
and i am sure you have a host of wild                    theories to answer these questions . 
you know damn well what i think . 
i do n't think he does .  not exactly but there 's a lot more to his story .  i want to know why twentyseven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninetyone million dollars worth of dope that was n't there .  above all i want to be sure that dean keaton is dead . 
why ? 
her doctors killed her . 
 i 'm sorry  .  .  .  ? 
her doctors murdered her .   they gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life .     her doctors murdered her . 
do you know who her doctors were ? 
i read the file .   yeah .   marx and towler .   i know who they were . 
the most respected  .  .  . 
whose side are you arguing  .  .  .  ?   i thought that you wanted to do something .   i do n't have any interest in the woman's estate'  no offense but we all know where the money 's going  to  .  .  .  i have an interest in the hospital  and i do n't want those bozos working in the same shop as me .   they gave her the wrong anesthetic .   they turned the girl into a vegetable .  they killed her and they killed her kid .   you caught em .   now how many others did they kill ? 
what are they going to do ?   not invite me to their birthday party  .  .  .  ?    look i gotta go .   i have to be in cambridge  .  .  . 
okay .   i 'll meet you here .   tuesday night  .  .  .  i gotta go .   you going my way ? 
i understand . 
 .  .  .  the case with anyone .   and i 'll meet you tuesday and we 'll go over your testimony  .  .  . 
 .  .  .  that 's perfectly all right . 
uh why why are you doing this ? 
to do right .   is n't that why you 're doing it ? 
i told the guy i did n't want to talk to .  .  . 
i 'll just take a minute .   deborah ann kaye .   you know what i 'm talking about .   the case is going to trial .  our chief witness is a dr .  david gruber you know who he is ? 
no . 
he 's the assistant chief of anesthesiology massachusetts commonwealth .   he says your doctors towler and marx put my girl in the hospital for life .   and we can prove that .   what we do n't know is why .   what went on in there ?   in the o . r .   that 's what we 'd like to know .   something went wrong .   and you know what it was .   they gave her the wrong anesthetic .   what happened ?   the phone rang .  .  . someone got distracted .  .  . what ? 
 .  .  . you got your doctor 's testimony .  why do you need me ? 
i want someone who was in the o . r .  we 're going to win the case there 's no  question of that .   it 's just a matter of how big .  .  . 
i 've got nothing to say to you . 
you know what happened . 
nothing happened . 
then why are n't you testifying for their side ? 
and ask me what ? 
who put my client in the hospital for life . 
i did n't do it mister . 
who are you protecting then ? 
who says that i 'm protecting anyone ? 
i do .   who is it ?   the doctors .  what do you owe them ? 
i do n't owe them a goddamn thing . 
then why do n't you testify ? 
you know you 're pushy fella .  .  . 
you think i 'm pushy now wait til i get you on the stand .  .  . 
well maybe you better do that then .    you know you guys are all the same .  you do n't care who gets hurt .  you 're a bunch of whores .   you 'd do anything for a dollar .   you got no loyalty .  .  . no nothing .  .  . you 're a bunch of whores . 
why is that ?

i had to quit midge . 
why ? 
i wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof .  .  .  and try to reach out for him . 
it was n't your fault . 
i know .  everybody tells me . 
johnny the doctors explained 
i know .  i have acrophobia .  what a disease .  a fear of heights .  and what a moment to find out i had it . 
well you 've got it .  and there 's no losing it .  and there 's no one to blame .  so why quit ? 
and sit behind a desk ?   chairborne ? 
it 's where you belong . 
not with my acrophobia midge .  if i dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up it could be disastrous ! 
ah johnnyo .  .  . 
nothing for a while .  you forget i 'm a man of independent means .  or fairly independent . 
mmm .  why do n't you go away for a while ? 
to forget ?  do n't be so motherly midge .  i 'm not going to crack up . 
have you had any dizzy spells this week ? 
i 'm having one now . 
oh ! 
i 've never run across one like that . 
it 's brand new .  revolutionary uplift .  no shoulder straps no back straps but does everything a brassiere should do .  it works on the principle of the cantilever bridge . 
uhhuh ! 
an aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it .  he worked it out in his spare time . 
what a pleasant hobby .

well ? 
normal .

you know there 's only one man in the world for me johnnyo . 
yeah i 'm a brute .  we were engaged once though were n't we ?

i got a call from him today .  funny .  he dropped out of sight during the war and i 'd heard he 'd gone east .  i guess he 's back .   it 's a mission number . 
that 's skid row .  .  .  is n't it ? 
could be . 
he 's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink . 
well i 'm on the bum i 'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles .  but not tonight .  if you wo n't drink with me i 'll drink alone tonight .  
sorry old man .  work . 
midge what did you mean there 's no losing it ? 
what . 
my .  .  .  the acrophobia . 
i asked my doctor .  he said only another emotional shock could do it and probably would n't .  and you 're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out . 
i think i can lick it . 
how ? 
i 've got a theory .  look .  if i can get used to heights just a little at a time .  .  .  progressively see ? 
that !  ?  !

as far as the public is concerned it is .  the reason you got fired and i got my second demo into production is i 'm a lot smarter than you .  i never give my best stuff away . 
how do you kill it ? 
separate the character module from the neural net .  .  . 
amazing .  i hate to say it but it is .

those days are over gordon .  they were over a long time ago . 
ca n't blame me for trying .  you look as beautiful as that painting i just bought . 
it 's not puppy love gordon .  anyway buddy and i are splitting up . 
sorry to hear that .  i thought the kid had staying power . 
it 's over you gordon . 
you told him about us ? 
no are you crazy ?  and i do n't want him ever to know .  do you understand ?  .  .  . 
now tell me why would i want to do that ? 
because i do n't want to see him hurt . 
do n't worry sunshine .  bud and i had a little talk .  we came to an understanding .   i want you to go back to him .  soothe him .  help keep his head straight .  okay ? 
i ca n't .  .  . and i wo n't . 
come on we both like buddy .  but this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top .  .  .  it does n't fit . 
maybe it does .  do n't patronize me gordon . 
you and i are the same darien .  we 're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running love .  .  .  a fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows . 
you 're really twisted gordon .  you 're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there 's a poverty that every last dollar in the world wo n't fill . 
ooh ooh tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grownup package .  does this mean you 're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own ?  because darien if you 're through with me you 're through with everything i 'm a part of . 
you got it g . g . 
he 's flowing gordo .  piece of cake . 
hey the terminator !  blow em away ollie .

congratulations but rarer still is your interest in anacott steel . 
the same interest as yours larry .  money .  i thought it 'd be a good investment for my kid .  .  . 
no .  this time i 'm in for the long term .  this is not a liquidation gordon .  i 'm going to turn it around .  you 're getting a free ride on my tail mate and with the dollars you 're costing me to buy back the stock i could modernize the plant .  i 'm not the only one who pays here gordon .  we 're talking about lives and jobs three and four generations of steel workers .  .  . 
i could break you mate in two pieces over my knees you know it i know it i could buy you six times ever i could dump the stock just to burn your ass but i happen to want the company and i want your block of shares .  i 'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow and i 'm expecting your commitment . 
no .   no i do n't . 
i 'm sorry that i frightened you like that .   but i was so touched by your concern .   i 've been lonely here .   perhaps we could be friends .

i guess so .   the trick is remembering how to act like one .   i 'm glad you called mr .  curry .  i wanted to see you .   why do n't we go to my office .  .  . 
'freak at the week .   that 's what the tv crew .  call it  people come right to the house .   they have a husband or wife who skipped town  or a missing kid  they bring a sweater or a toy  and ask me to touch it .  so i can teel them where they are .  . 
i 'm glad you 're around to say it . 
my jury 's still out on that
then call it in .  mr .  curry .  whatever 's happeninq to you  death is not the preferable alternative .   i 'm in the life business  remember .  .  ? 
as far as touching things yes .  but the vision  that keeps pouring into my head    it wo n't go away god  if i could just understand it . 
nothing .   absolutely nothing
the one time i want it to work .  .  . 
you know  doors and keyholes are common signposts in outofbody 
you 're not gonna give me the textbook analysia are you doctor .  .  .  ?  my vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygenstarved brain  and nobody 
no .  i 'm not .   doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things . 
yes  i have had it for years . 
i really do n't know what to say
sure .  .  .

yes one and a half please . 
i 'm a dentist
and how long have you been a dentist ? 
let me get this straight .  .  . 
if it is n't straight by now son you probably should see a doctor . 
these are real live women ? 
we do n't generally feature blowup dolls in our magazine .  but hey if you think there 's a market for it . 
god i love being dead . 
we reinvented ourselves . 
new hushpuppies do n't make a new man . 
you 've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar italian loafers . 
that explains the emptiness that haunts me . 
jealousy is so unattractive . 
he kicked major ass and you know it . 
from your lips to god 's ears . 
you go first . 
ladies first .   i insist . 
well .  the prom 's coming up . 
yeah ? 
and i was wondering . 
yeah ? 
if you do n't have .  .  . i mean .  .  . 
shut up !   are you serious ?  of course i will .  .  . of course . 
you like me .  i like you .  i guess it 's pretty obvious to everyone . 
i do n't like you .  we 're just friends . 
but that smile . 
oh ted duh .   i smile at everyone since i got my braces off . 
so you 'll think about it ? 
so that 's a maybe ? 
the answer is never ted never .  except maybe in your dreams . 
yeah ?  you like ? 
makes your shoulders look so big and broad . 
christy ?   you want to be in heaven ? 
i turned eighteen over spring break .  i 'm eligible . 
i do ?  i mean yeah i do . 
i have to admit i am so totally turned on .  we should do it .  now . 
do it ? 
you know .  .  . take the pictures ? 
but how would we pay our bills ? 
oh .  goodness . 
you 're free .   you can do anything you ever wanted to do ! 
like what ? 
like take that trip to buckingham palace .  go deep sea fishing in the gulf of mexico .  now 's your chance . 
forget the store .  think big . 
oh teddy .  we missed you so much . 
do n't say shit honey .  use the strong vocabulary god gave you . 
thanks principal merkin . 
i 'll be blunt .  i know you can take it . 
yes sir .  i 'll brace myself . 
ted you are the best editor this school paper ever had .  you do n't need to be pandering flesh .  it 's nonsense .  it 's beneath you . 
you think i ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks ?  i do n't want your silly billion dollar empire ? 
that 's a good start yes .  a very good start . 
are you kidding ?  this magazine is my dream .  it 's every redblooded heterosexual male 's dream . 
i never figured you for a pimp . 
have you ever even looked at heaven ? 
what kind of sick question is that ?  i 'll be watching you young man .  your money and power mean nothing here .  nothing . 
i guess you wo n't be wanting that rolex i sent you then ? 
we cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community ! 
if that were true this would be one seriously constipated town .  most guys in xenia have been looking at naked girls in heaven since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress . 
rules are rules . 
come on it 's our only senior prom . 
deaf ears mr .  nelson .  i answer to a higher power . 
a statue in front of city hall dedicated to principal dick merkin ? 
i 'm warning you . 
a new pediatric wing at the hospital ?  a presidential campaign ?  name it .  anything . 
mr .  nelson you disappoint me .  first you break our school board rules .  then you break the law . 
what law merk ?  having fun ?  letting down our hair on prom night ? 
our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking . 
you called the cops on us ? 
alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind . 
you think this is just about money about us looking foolish ?   question him .  you 're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath .   and those girls are going to wind up dead .  .  . 
get off this ray now .   if there is any evidence here it 's for homicide .   you get an id you call me . 
just tell us what happened . 
i told kelly van ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder .   i did her rights . 
bit scratched .   but i had her pinned .  she calmed down .   i was going to cuff her .  .  .  she said she thought she was going to be sick .   she asked to use the bathroom . 
you did n't cuff her ? 
she looked shaky but lucid .   i thought i would just go with her stand at the door .  .  .   i think i looked away .   a split second .  then bingo .   just like that .   she puts a knee into my groin .   there was this coffee table between us and the wall .   she got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case .   thing had a glass door .   i could hear it breaking .   i did n't go down but she slowed me up just enough .   before i could get to her she 'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun .   i yelled at her to put it down .   she got off a shot .   i took it in the shoulder .   i .  .  .  i had no choice .  i returned fire .   two rounds i think .  in the chest . 
suzie toller 's .   and that 's the only thing saving your sorry ass . 
yeah .  .  .  okay .  .  .  he did
and then what .  .  .  he touched you ?   did you maybe flirt a little .  .  . 
i wanna go home now . 
shit what difference does it make .  .  .  nobody 's gonna believe me anyway .  .  . 
suzie !   did this man rape you ? 
okay !   he did .   he pushed me to the floor and he did it to me .   now can i go home ? 
i 'm sorry .  .  .  you said it hurt ?   why ? 
because .  .  .  it was the biggest i 've ever seen .   and i 've seen a lot on their way through jack 's fish camp . 
i said he did . 
ms .  toller .   i 'm asking you now under oath did samuel lonbardo rape you ? 
listen kelly skipped school .   have you talked to her ? 
no . 
shit .  here we go again . 
did n't you see her this morning ? 
to tell you the truth i have n't seen her since friday . 
so maybe i 'm a onewoman man . 
goodbye sandra . 
jim west . 
artemus gordon .   bach he 's the composer . 
i do n't mind him but who the hell are you .  .  .  my valet or something ? 
valet ?   you jest of course .   i am a u . s .  marshal . 
funny .   so am i . 
congratulations .   unfortunately my train is about to leave and i really must insist you disembark . 
your train ?   listen friend you 're obviously lost .    .  .  .  i 've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime . 
interesting .   mine say the same thing and they do n't mention you not even as a valet although we could talk .  .  . 
funny i was just thinking you should do the same .   since i am already in residence and am obviously the man for the job it 's been grand making your acquaintance sir .   and best of luck in all your future endeavors . 
if you 're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion then i for one am fully prepared to do so .  .  .  al fresco . 
would n't dream of it . 
put them all together and what do we have ? 
a giant .  .  .  hydraulically operated microscope .  .  .  that explodes ?   or maybe just someone who hates scientists . 
then why kidnap them ?   why not just kill them ? 
ay there 's the rub .   take a look at this file on professor morton .   quite a brilliant fellow .  .  .  metallurgy . 
wait a minute .   now i know where i 've heard of you .   you 're the gadget guy . 
gadget guy ?   while i may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses i am sir in my own humble way a man of science . 
you need that real often ? 
always hoping .   or this .  .  . 
no offense but all i ever need .  .  .   are these .  .  .   and this . 
good lord man .   the world is changing .   and mark me it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention .   we as defenders of the right must keep pace ! 
all right if it 'll make you happy i 'll try that . 
try what ? 
exactly !   you are on foreign soil .  you are a representative of the occupying forces .   or have n't you checked a map lately ?  ! 
that would be .  .  .  the mexican war ? 
call it what you like .   the point is i was heir to that land mr .  west .   it belonged to my beloved grandmother !   now i intend to have it back .   my own country ! 
emperor miguelito .  .  .  ? 
the first . 
well your highness what makes you think we 'll ever sign a treaty with you ? 
because i am holding all the western territories hostage mr .  west !   a town a day will disappear !   willard was merely a test run a stroll in the park .   next i level all of albuquerque !   yes that 's right .   only yesterday i learned what you undoubtedly already know your own president will be there .   what an added bonus !  the gods are shining on me !   after tomorrow every american citizen will rise up and demand i be given back my humble little empire ! 
so i 'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an emperor and a murderer ? 
easy ?   easy ?   on just what grounds should i take it easy !  ? 
yes ! 
who were they ?   what do they want with me ? 
we 'll explain on the way . 
who was this partner of his ? 
a southern gentlemen .   i do n't recall his name .   i suppose it 's unkind of me to say it but he had the most disconcerting glass eye . 
a glass eye ?   that 's who it was !  oneeyed jack garrison .   otherwise known as general garrison confederate third army .   i saw him at dr .  loveless' party but i could n't place him .   he used to wear an eyepatch . 
for the moment .   but i fear not for long .   i 'm of no use to him now . 
he 's just full of plans that are n't gonna work out . 
it 's a smelting retort . 
i must concetrate my imagination .  .  . to creat a new .  .  . reality ! 
what 's the magician's weapon ? 
the limitless power of .  .  . 
i ca n't remember all these things .  what am i learning ? 
the art of transformation ! 
me ! 
that 's the life spark .   exxence of magic and sorcery ! 
shhhhh ! 
we need blood .   to nourish the stone .   charge the stone with ener gy . 
his will . 
now use it . 
no !   change me back into a sor ceress willow . 
there 's nobody here . 
use the philosopher 's stone !   hur ry !   invocation !   release them ! 
what the hell are you talking about ?  what 's happening . 
nothing .  i 'm not going to be around for a while .  i 'll call you when i can . 
johnny what the fuck ? 
listen to me  schaeffer 's part of it .  maybe at the top of it . 
i hear you . 
good .  take care of that woman's name for me .  and watch your ass . 
johnny !  where the hell have you been ? 
never mind .  i 'm coming in to take care of business .  how hot am i ? 
too hot .  do n't do it .  do n't come in . 
i 'm coming . 
listen johnny do n't do anything stupid .  you could n't get within a mile of schaeffer right now .  so stay put .  .  .  stay in touch  i 'll let you know when maybe it makes sense . 
i hear you .  i 'll stay in touch . 
that 's more like it .   where are you at anyway ? 
say again ? 
make that 1790 . 
wrong . 
you 'd lie to protect him . 
probably . 
i admit i do n't know where he is . 
you 're the first one he 'll contact . 
he 's got my number . 
what i know paul is .  .  .   he 's going to take you out .  .  . 
not yet . 
he accused john of taking kickbacks .  and you know  anybody who knows john  knows that 's a goddamn lie ! 
of course elaine .  but as long as there 's any question better johnny should come back and clear his name . 
better you should get off my front porch before i get my mace ! 
elaine i do n't want to have to take you in for questioning .  you 've got his car you were the last to see him 
i do n't know where he is . 
but .  .  .  if you had to guess ? 
what sort of an animal is that ? 
itititit  it 's a huge one ! 
i 'm sure he could give you some courage . 
oh 
do n't you know the wizard 's going to give you some courage ? 
oh !   oh tin man !    oh ! 
now come on  you 're acting silly  
i knew you would ! 
you 've had plenty of time already ! 
yes .  .  .  ! 
look  it ticks ! 
bbbbbbut if we do that we 'll have to kill her to get it ! 
it 's empty .  the tinsmith forgot to give me a heart . 
i 'll see you reach the wizard whether i get a heart of not .   beehive  bah !   let her try and make a beehive out of me !  you know  hmm ?  what 's that ? 
no sir ! 
we do . 
to oz ? 
to oz ! 
some  but mostly lions and tigers and bears . 
i 'd be clever as a gizzard 
a heart 
hurry  hurry 
look  you can see it here .   it 's wonderful ! 
emerald city ! 
i used my body on the guards .   it gave me control .  i got to a gun and i took my chance .   ive never told anyone that . 
a little .  does it matter ?  after all whats the point of living if you cant feel alive ?   isnt that right elektra ?  isnt that your motto ? 
what are you talking about ? 
or did you steal it from your old friend renard ? 
 .  .  . what ? 
we had a runin he and i .  he knew about us he knew about my shoulder he knew exactly where to hurt me .  .  . 
you can drop the act its over . 
i dont know what youre talking about ! 
i think you do . 
he used your exact words . 
you knew .   you knew all the time that he was out there that he was coming for me and you lied .  you used me you used me as bait .  you made love to me  what to pass the time as you waited for him to strike ? 
you do what you have to do but ive called in m .   shes en route from london even now . 
not interested . 
soon shell be everywhere . 
five more turns and your neck will break . 
you turned renard . 
just like you .  .  . only you were even easier . 
he killed me !  he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom . 
i know what you 're thinking .   you 'd be a lot safer if i were n't around . 
laurie 
i 'm an open target dan .   if you 're with me 
with any luck the world 'll end before we get ours . 
memory lane . 
 i thought it was time for a routine maintenance check . 
antarctica ?  ? 
adrian's headed down to his secret retreat .   he invited us to come along .   i 've been thinking .   if things do get nasty  .   .   .  it would n't be a bad place to sit out a war . 
would you want to sit out a war ?   i mean  what would be left . 
you and me . 
me neither .   mine barely even fits .   the thing is i try to remember why we did it and i ca n't .   helping people or righting wrongs or trying to save the world  .   .   .  i do n't know .   it all seems so abstract . 
what are you up to ? 
do n't look .   turn around . 
okay ! 
it 's a peace rally .   the ctu 's just opened fire on the crowd . 
oh laurie .   jesus .   no . 
all right .   mission accomplished . 
i do n't want to take em out .   just want to keep em interested . 
they 're practically on us  .   .   . 
that detroit shit ?   i 'm so worried . 
no something worse .  he says it 's a surprise but i know him .  this is his masterpiece . 
we 've got to find out what it is .  can you handle that ? 
there 's something i did n't have time to tell you before . 
what 's that ? 
i 'm a agent as well .  kgb .  i 've been undercover for over a year . 
you 're what ?  what the hell have you been doing ? 
i do n't know .  eight months ago i stop hearing from my people .  no explanation just silence .  so i stay and i wait like i was told .  soon i 'm in so far they 'd kill me if i left .  now every day i get farther and farther away from what i was .  i 'm like you said a criminal . 
i 'm busted up for you but jesus what the hell are you doing ?  those people almost drowned on that boat and you did n't lift a finger . 
get your head back in the game .  there are lives at stake here . 
of course .  i 'll do what i can .  i have to go before they notice . 
when can i see you again ? 
you ca n't it 's too risky .  i 'm not much help anyway remember ? 
what the hell are you doing ?  you could 've killed me ! 
i heard you talking .  i could tell where you were in the room . 
i do n't know what 's going on anymore .  i thought i was square with that dude .  now everybody 's switching sides like it 's the wwf . 
i know which cops are good and which are bad .  come with me .  come on right now . 
we 're getting out of this place .  we 've done enough . 
wait a minute whoa .  we ca n't go now .  what 's yorgi got planned with that nerve agent ? 
it does n't matter anymore forget it . 
of course it matters .  hey hold on ! 
what do we owe our governments ?  yours kidnapped you mine abandoned me . 
petra this ai n't about the people that sent us here you know that . 
no now it 's about us .  let 's do something for us before we both get killed .  do n't you want to get to bora bora xander ? 
we ca n't leave now .  we have to do something . 
why ?  you 're the one who believes in nothing .  screw the world or whatever you said . 
we 'll have to go after them . 
are n't you afraid ? 
a long time ago i learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head .  maybe that 's my problem .  if you do n't feel fear you can do some amazing things but you can also screw your life up in ways you ca n't imagine . 
i must be healthy then because i 'm scared to death .  i guess i 'd better get back to yorgi . 
you do n't have to do that . 
yes i do .  you 're right .  i ca n't just let him go free .  besides i can help you from the inside . 
are n't they gonna wonder were you 've been ? 
i was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop .  they 'll believe me .   i 've been lying for so long one more time wo n't hurt . 
when this is over we 're just gonna take off the two of us .  take a vacation . 
what the hell are we doing ?  we 're doing all this together trusting each other making plans and we have n't even slept together yet . 
he 's a regular humanitarian .  and all this time i thought he was just a tool . 
let me guess they had a big white torpedo with them . 
if they launch it i know how to bring it back . 
let 's do this . 
he owns a big industrial complex on the river .  he 'll launch it from there . 
in the road to survival there is always sacrifice logan .   we are the future .  .  .  not them .   we must protect ourselves .   after tonight when the leaders of the world return home  they will return as brothers as mutants .  .  .  and our cause will be theirs .   this is survival i know you understand that logan .  .  .  or is it wolverine ? 
i brought you here so that you would be safe from magneto . 
who ? 
a very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you .  i 'm not sure why but until we find out i must ask you to stay . 
deal . 
this .   this whole god damn thing .   making yourselves into some sort of team of superpowered freaks .  teaching wayward mutants about classical literature .   for what ? 
what if it never happens ?   what if they 're so afraid of us that we become the enemy ?   this place is gonna be one giant cemetery . 
no .   that 's me talking .   and you know what ?   it 's only been thirtytwo hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me . 
i believe he wants you for your adamantium . 
to find rogue . 
how ? 
the brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being . 
actually magneto helped me put it together . 
he helped you ? 
we were friends once .  .  .   but that was a long time ago . 
i 'll go . 
they 're all asking how you 're doing .  are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone ? 
actually i 'm feeling up to leaving . 
you must n't take it so hard .  bucharest was n't built in a day . 
well i do n't like to see you mope . 
i 'm sorry .   i do n't mean to take out my frustration on you .   you 've been a great help to me and i 've let you down . 
you 're right !   selfpity never got anyone anywhere .   let 's go back and finish our dinner . 
who are you talking to ? 
to you !   you just made a yummy' sound so i thought you liked the dessert . 
i did n't make a yummy' sound  i just asked what it was . 
but you did  i just heard it . 
it was n't me . 
i suppose you 're right .   inga !  prepare a sedative just in case . 
do n't fall for that one . 
but do n't you see .  .  . the brain of hans delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk  pleading with us .   i 've got to untie it . 
careful master  you never can tell with these chaps . 
give  me  your  hand ! 
you can say that again . 
yes . 
you 're just supposed to repeat what you said . 
why ? 
i 'm not trying to be funny . 
yes . 
how quickly can you move your artillery forward ? 
well my horses are feeding as you may observe mr coghill .  it 'll take a little while . 
well fed or hungry pulleine wants them in position immediately .   . 
right .   bombardier to me please . 
um .  there are rumours that my lord chelmsford intends to make durnford second in command . 
well that 's typical of her majesty 's army .  appoint an engineer to do a soldier 's work . 
which one ? 
well that one .  the one who keeps looking at me . 
ft could be you flatter yourself coghill it 's that odd eye . 
keep steady .  you 're the best shots of the twentyfourth .  you bunch of heathens do it
good ones yes mr vereker .  gentlemen who can ride and shoot
i 'm to take the sikali with the main column to the river
lord chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my basutos . 
i think chelmsford wants a good man on the border why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady commander in reserve . 
and i assure you you do not in fact i 'd be obliged for your best advice .  what have your scouts seen ? 
so far only their scouts .  but we have had reports of a small impi farther north over there .
